Of the many interesting stories in *Between the World and Me*, I keep coming back to one in particular. The story takes place in a movie theater in the Upper West Side, after Ta-Nehisi Coates takes his son to see *Howl's Moving Castle*.

>The theater was crowded, and when we came out...you were moving at the dawdling speed of a small child. A white woman pushed you and said, "Come on!" (p.93-4).

Shocked and upset, Coates confronted her: "my words were hot with all of the moment and all of my history" (p.94). Things escelate as the crowd sides with the woman, and the story culminates in a white man telling him "I could have you arrested!"

Coates lingers on this story longer than usual, taking time to unpack the dynamics at play. There's the contrast of his blackness in the mostly-white Upper West Side. There's the way that history transforms a threat of arrest into a threat on his life. But then Coates begins to wonder how he might have communicated this to the woman that pushed his son; could he have brought her to see her own actions as he did, with all their historical coloring?

### Background

The questions raised here touch on an ancient dilemma in ethics, the result of two competing and deeply-ingrained ethical frameworks:

------------

#### Socrates
No person *knowingly* does wrong. What appears to be malice is in fact ignorance, and this ignorance is primarily an ignorance of the nature of one's soul.

This framework emphasizes **reasoning** as the means of moral reform; calling on the wrongdoer to **examine** their error.

--------------

#### Christianity
We are all in sin, and sin is a state of *knowingly* rejecting truth and the good. Individual sins are acts in which one *knowingly does wrong*, or else fails to do what one knows to be right.

This framework emphasizes **accountability** as the means of moral reform; calling on the wrongdoer to **repent**.

--------------

This is, of course, a simplification of two very rich (and long and convoluted) traditions. More can be (and has been) said on either side, but for the sake of expediency, I invite you to consider them as laid out.

In their barest form, these ethical frameworks are *incompatible* with one another. One cannot endorse them both at once. and---going by the principle of non-contradiction---neither can one employ their dictates simultaneously. One might use each of them to illuminate a single situation, but at some point one must make the transition, from education to accountability or vice versa. Politically, whichever framework one chooses may not effect the policies or points made so much as the reasons used in articulating and championing them.

This dynamic of two competing, incompatible interpretive frameworks underlies all of our normative talk and our attempts to actually address injustice. As such, it's no coincidence to find it at the heart of the story of the woman at the theater, and as a general concern in *Between the World and Me*. I do not wish to get caught up in the metaphysical and epistemological nuances that underlie each position: I only want to consider, in light of Ta-Nehisi Coates and the pressing context of American racism, which position bears a closer *likeness to the truth*---which is more helpful for resolving the problem presented by the woman at the theater?

### The Problem

Coates considers the Socratic approach to the woman at the theater accordingly:

>Had I informed this woman that when she pushed my son, she was acting according to a tradition that held black bodies as lesser, her response would likely have been, "I am not racist." Or maybe not. But my experience in this world has been that the people who believe themselves to be white are obsessed with the politics of personal exoneration. And the word racist, to them, conjures, if not a tobacco-spitting oaf, then something just as fantastic---an orc, troll, or gorgon (97).

Coates wants to explain the situation, to reason with the woman, but he anticipates that this would only come across as an accusation. We see here a way in which, one could say, the Christian framework turns to thwart the propper functioning of the Socratic: we open with the Socratic, but the wrong-doer recieves the Christian---an accusation that they deliberately harbor contempt---and responds *within* the Christian framework. I believe Coates is right in suspecting this kind of discourse to be unproductive.

This pattern is a general one, though it seems especially common in racially-charged encounters, precisely because of the history of these "politics of personal exhoneration." Coates lists examples that span the entire twentieth century, from Michael Richards to Strom Thurmond to the segregationist residents of Levittown, PA. Each of them deny their racism, no matter how clearly their actions fit the structure and function of white supremacy.

### In Favor of the Socratic

One possible conclusion we could draw from this is in favor of the Socratic framework---and I would say is the more prominent view among politically-conscious young people today. This holds that the Christian framework---the idea that wrong acts are inherently bound up in intention---is precisely the problem. It is unrealistic and misses the force of history, the fact that, as Coates councils his son, "there was no golden era when evildoers did their business and loudly proclaimed it as such" (p.98). Proponents of this view might hold that, actually, *all* white people are racist, while ammending racism to mean "unconsciously participating in structures that endanger and disenfranchise people of color." This is an attempt to remedy the way in which emphasizing _intention_ as a defining element of racism turns it into an impossible ideal, and allows the Christian framework to undermine the Socratic.

Coates's point here does seem to fit this interpretation: the impossible ideal of intentional racism tends to obscure the operations of systematic racism, by making individual injustices suspect to an extraordinary and *un*reasonable doubt, establishing plausible deniability for  As long as [[find a snippet]] "no racial epithets were uttered"---as long as the white woman didn't proclaim her racism loudly to the world, then we are forced into race-blindness. Even *raising* the racial context of a situation like that becomes insulting, an insinuation of a deliberate dimension that was not there.

### In Favor of the Christian

Yet I am convinced that there *is* some sort of knowledge/intention involved here, and in the same story of the woman at the theater, Coates suggests as much. He writes:

>I knew for instance, that she would not have pushed a black child out on my part of Flatbush, because she would be afraid there and would sense, if not know, that there would be a penalty for such an action (94).

This is a very unrefined kind of knowledge, this sensing-if-not-knowing. The Socratic framework can still admit of it, as it would not pass muster for proper Socratic knowledge, the kind at stake in the claim that nobody knowingly does wrong. The Socratic term for it would instead be _unrecollected_ knowledge: knowledge that we have forgotten that we know. We need help remembering. And no doubt a little bit of Socratic interrogation could bring this woman to remember that "no, I would not have pushed your kid out on your part of Flatbush."

Yet this kind of knowledge is not *simply* forgotten, the way we have forgotten the forms through the exhaustion of eternity; this knowledge, like sin, is more akin to a *repressed memory*. Out of shame or terror or despair, we buried it in the past, in the unexamined anals of our country's history. Every now and again, given some opportunity, it threatens to arise, and rather than embrace this as a truth of the world that one is rediscovering, we stomp it back down. So with Coates's account of the politics of personal exhoneration:

>The mettle that it takes to look away from the horror of our prison system, from police forces transformed into armies, from the long war against the black body, is not forged overnight. This is the practiced habit of jabbing out one’s eyes and forgetting the work of one’s hands (p.98).

This is not the simple ignorance of those watching the shadows in Plato's cave. For white America, it is not an arduous climb to get to the surface. There is television in this cave, and we are neither chained to the wall nor any single channel. One needs to *will* to remain ignorant, and the willful act of "jabbing out one's eyes" betrays an awareness of what they might otherwise see. The phrase “forgetting the work of one’s hands” is particularly interesting---nobody *simply* forgets the work of their hands. White Americans have *agency* in the construction and perpetuation of American racism. This agency is sufficient evidence for this repressed knowledge in the cases of supposed white ignorance; if this agency is not readily apparent, then it has been *obscured*. Is the act of obscuring similarly forgotten? There is an infinite regress here: somewhere down the line, the act of repression is still apparent, and this is precisely what the *opportunity* triggers; this last unburried action theatens to bring the whole choice surging back into awareness.

[[It is by no sheer coincidence that white America tends to entertain an ideology of their supremacy; they maintain it primarily *because* it benefits them.]]

What this ammounts to is that one does not generally endorse and participate in white supremacy out of a commitment to the truth (innocently enough led astray by false beliefs), but out of convenience---that is, a negative commitment, a total lack of commitment. *This* is why the woman at the theater is closed off to honest dialogue; not because she *confuses* (innocently enough) an explanation with an accusation, but because the knowledge involved in the act of pulling rank, like sin, ammounts to an *active refusal of love*---a refusal to accept the loving embrace of an honest upturning.

Coates could have offered that love to the woman in the theater; he could have become the opportunity for this woman to acknowledge how far from love she had fallen. He didn't, knowing that she likely would have refused it ("I'm not racist"). But it ultimately doesn't matter, as the opportunity is incidental to the sin. Living in the Upper West Side, a white person may commit less actual microaggressions for sheer lack of opportunity. Their sins are no less for this. We did not and will never recieve the *opportunity* to crucify Christ; yet we are no better for that. We tend to imagine ourselves among the poor, the wretched and meek being blessed, if not among the disciples. Yet were we alive in Christ's time, we would have eagerly driven home the nails. We are guilty of this sin, but even more guilty of forgetting this sin.

[[tonal change: turns into Anti-Climacus for a long while. That tonal shift is fine but shouldn't derail, should be shorter]]

----------------

Ignoring the role of intention in systematic and discrete racism seems just as problematic as insisting upon it; to ignore the role of intention is, in a way, to accept the account of racism as a kind of natural phenomenon, where nobody can be held any more accountable than another, where lynchings are carried out by "persons unknown"---the account that turns an _outrageous_ act into a _tragic_ one.

Coates knows exactly how dangerous this misunderstanding is; how it *actively* manifests in failed accountability and a shrugged acceptance of racialized violence:

>In this way, racism is rendered as the innocent daughter of Mother Nature, and one is left to deplore the Middle Passage or the Trail of Tears the way one deplores an earthquake, a tornado, or any other phenomenon that can be cast as beyond the handiwork of men (p.7).

>...my death would not be the fault of any human but the fault of some unfortunate but immutable fact of ‘race,’ imposed upon an innocent country by the inscrutable judgment of invisible gods. The earthquake cannot be subpoenaed. The typhoon will not bend under indictment. They sent the killer of Prince Jones back to his work, because he was not a killer at all. He was a force of nature, the helpless agent of our world’s laws (p.83).

[[This is the downfall of the Socratic framework, the view that no one knowingly does wrong, that racism is simply an unconscious participation in oppressive structures. Its downfall is *fatalism*. Yet we cannot forget that the Christian framework *also* has its downfall, insisting on a sense of racism that establishes plausible deniability. Its downfall is *essentialism*.]]

When Coates slips, he seems to slip towards this fatalism, the annihilation of any concrete, graspable agencies in the vortex of white supremacy. __Yet he clearly understands the importance of holding onto these agencies, of understanding that white people *must* in some way understand why their racist beliefs are wrong---that they are not held for truth's sake but out of convenience.__ Much later, he describes visiting Gettysburg with his son, [[review context]]:

>By the time I visited those battlefields, I knew that they had been retrofitted as the staging ground for a great deception, and this was my only security, because they could no longer insult me by lying to me. I knew—and the most important thing I knew was that, somewhere deep with them [sic], they knew too (106).

Somewhere, *somewhere* in there, racists understand their racism. How then, do we bring this understanding out? Or is this just a fact for our own "security," that we might remain righteous, that we might not accept the myth of white supremacy as a great and faceless storm?

### Resolution

I previously set up the Christian and Socratic ethical frameworks as opposite extremes. Through Coates, we can see that *both* extremes are problematic. Both vanish the concrete instances of racism, whether by chopping them off from their historical context or else by undermining the agency involved. Is there any productive alternative?

[[comment]]

This knowledge, indeed, accurately represents the structure of systematic racism---it _needs_ to in order for white people to be able to take advantage of their place in it so well and so frequently.

All of this seems to be known, by Socratic lights. The only thing that seems to be _not_ known Socratically is that this whole structure of white supremacy is bad _for whites_; i.e. for those ... It seems apparent enough that---if this were understood---white people would *not* take advantage of their priviledge, because doing so actually puts them at a disadvantage... This depends upon a theoretical argument that would crib the form of Plato's argument in the *Republic* that it is better to suffer under tyranny than to be a tyrant; that it is better to be oppressed than to be an oppressor. Coates, interestingly enough, expresses this sentiment to his son....

The Socratic line of thinking, then, would offer this solution to the problem: to teach white America that white supremacy is *not* in their own self interest---that it benefits nobody more than a system of egalitarianism, that it functions as an elitist tool to divide the lower class against itself. The primary remedies in this framework are education and economic equality--systematic reforms.

------------

### Argument for the Socratic

Socrates' argument that to be oppressed is better than to oppress runs like this:

 - To oppress is more shameful
	 - what is more shameful must be so either by virtue of being more painful or harmful [*kakon*]
	 - oppressing is less painful than being oppressed
	 - therefore, oppressing is more harmful (less beneficial) than to be oppressed
 - We prefer a lesser harm to a greater harm
	 - *regardless of pain*: the association of preference with benefit is almost tautological
	 - ex: pre-anesthetic cultures practiced amputation, which despite excruciating pain does benefit a person's body
 - So we will prefer to be oppressed than to oppress

This seems to hold up *only* if society at large has a reasonable sense of shame---that is, only if they feel shame for doing what is unjust (since Socrates does not equate the two).

My worry with this is that, in the case of a systematic injustice like that presented by American racism, shame doesn't get traction. It is *not* clearly shameful in American now for one to expound white supremacy (although it should be). People who do this are hailed as speaking truth to power, "telling it like it is," and then get nominated for president.

Socrates did not face a situation like this, where *even though* racism harms whites *qua* Americans as a whole, it does not harm whites *qua* whites: it benefits them, offers them positions of prestige and power within their own circles, within many of the most normative institutions.

Pain and harm (the Socratic roots of shame) are agent-relative, and here question of whether oppressing is more harmful than being oppressed is not clear: it is more harmful from the standpoint of a broader society. And it is supremey beneficial from the standpoint of the oppressor. For the individual, it simply depends which of these she identifies with: if she identifies as white before she identifies as American (and, intrinsic to this, is well embedded with others who identify the same way, who support this identity) then she will likely benefit greatly from endorcing white supremacy; she will be elevated politically, financially, and socially, securing her priviledge and those of her children.

Plato openly worried that the absense of a proper sense of shame made not just moral conduct [[accountability to actions]], but *rational discourse* [[accountability for speech]] impossible. Two of his most infamous characters---Callicles of the *Gorgias* and Thrasymachus [[sp?]] of the *Republic*---lack exactly this basic sense of shame. When Socrates points out contradictions in their views, they embrace them, taking the opportunity to deride his method as childish and unrealistic. In both cases, Socrates and his interlocutors leave without resolving anything; they don't even arrive at *aporia*, just frustration and confusion. Even Socrates cannot correct their false beliefs, and when wrong action ammounts to false beliefs, this lack of shame seems to be a prerequisit for moral reform; without it, we cannot get better.

If my assessment is accurate that white supremacy is quickly becoming less shameful among white Americans (although it has never been truly shameful), then how is anti-racist progress possible? (I am committed, along with Coates, that we need to *believe* it is possible; we need to take up the struggle for its own sake [[is that the same thing?]].) But where do we start; where can white America find a toehold to pull itself up and out of its own filth? [[eh, maybe cut whole pp]]

For this view of these frameworks as conflicting interprative traditions, I mainly have to thank S&#248;ren Kierkegaard and his *Philosophical Fragments*. Reacting against Hegel's claims on Christianity, he sought to set Christianity and philosophy apart from one another. Ironically, in doing so he clarified their relationship in such a way as to finally bring them into authentic contact.

Luckily, this is where Christianity sees all of us; this state of shameless, willful helplessness, this active turning away from truth, reason and light, is *exactly* the state of sin. (Kierkegaard's claim that Socrates could point this out to us, but that he could not in fact help us out of it, seems to be anticipated already in Plato.) Sin is the turning away from Truth and the Good; a misrelation between oneself and the source of oneself. While it has otherwise been called "idle talk" (Heidegger) or "bullshit" (LOOKUP), this state is in fact sin; it is the state in which one trades love of others for love of oneself, and in doing so, turns inward and arrives at a place in which one is unreceptive to the love of others---in which the loving engagement of others must be repeatedly rejected in order to maintain the absolute rightness of one's own atomic self. That I am trading the "love of God" or "love of Christ" for the "love of others" will, I hope, not throw my readers off the central point: that the *attitude* and the existential *state* required for rejecting these loves is one and the same. Any written or unwritten theological theories as to the identity of the love of others with the love of God, while exciting, need not distract us from the task at hand.

The Christian solution rests upon the notion that maintaining oneself in this state (of shamless irrationality) requires a constant and deliberate application of effort. The sinner repeatedly chooses her sin. Necessary in this, there is *some* knowledge or covert awareness that one is willfully refusing love, choosing untruth, hearing what they want to hear. In our case, this can be explained as such: it is *no simple coincidence* that white Americans tend towards embracing an ideology that directly benefits them at the expence of people of color. This is not a simple error---a failure to reconcile one's views. This is [[COATES QUOTE]]. This is not ignorance but *temptation*, and submitting to temptation always contains an awareness of this submission, an awareness that one endorses white supremacy, not because of misguided opinions or unfounded beliefs, but primarily because it is supremely *convenient* to endorse an ideology that benefits oneself at the expence of people of color. It is easy, and sometimes even celebrated to take this perverse solidarity with one's white kin. One need not be self-aware of this to have it pointed out; one is *already acting* according to this knowledge.

White Americans do not deny the reality of racism in American out of true belief, but out of a (tacitly understood, vaguely grasped) sense that one will benefit from denying it. The politics of personal exoneration are not concerned with uncovering the true structure of our society; this structure simply doesn’t play a part in the claims (and even genuine fears!) of the ‘attack on white America.’

[[Augustine: the idea that we would have acted appropriately if we had known is a matter of human *pride*: a failure to take responsibility for one's sin (*On Grace and Free Will*, chpt. II).]]

[[Augustice: "It is one thing to be ignorant, and another thing to be unwilling to know. For the will is at fault in the case of the man of whom it is said, 'He is not inclined to understand, so as to do good'" (OGaFW, chpt. V).]]

The Christian framework accepts that dialogue is necessary to atone as a nation, but it is not sufficient---it is not itself atonement. This approach is necessary for understanding our sin---America's sin---but following this understanding, the Christian calls on white America to *repent*. The Christian believes that there are some (and now we are probably looking at the cultural elites) who fully understand both the nature of systematic racism *and* the way it disadvantages whites and deprives oppressors of virtue/humanity. And yet even this understanding does not prevent them from taking advantage of their priviledge---from permitting and reinforcing racism.

[[The christian framework calls on white America to repent.]]
......

I want to bring Kierkegaard back in here because his work in synthesizing the two traditions has interesting implications for our purposes. Dialogue is insufficient, yet it also *must* precede repentance; it is a necessary condition for acknowledging one's priviledge and taking responsibility for systemic injustice.

[[BIG NOTE: knowledge here is not actually attained: Socrates never *convinces* Callicles through rational argument that he is in sin, but he continues to engage him in dialogue *so as to forcibly draw his attention to his denial*---so as to make the active denial of truth, reason and the good (which is always active) *explicit*, so as to make it an issue and force it into consideration. Success here is not important; one does not need to convert the racist crowd. One engages in this way purely out of love (*eros*), as Socrates did. This is what it means to love your enemy: to [[QUOTE]]]]
"If I had not come and spoken unto them, they would not have sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin." (John 15:22)

In either case [[failed or successful reasoning]] this act *shows* the other their error, their sin. If their intention was involved in it (if they sinned), then they will not be able to accept this; racism (like sin) must obscure its own activity in order to propperly (or impropperly) operate. If their intention was not there---if their belief was truly unexamined---then they may be more open to it. But *in either case*, the key function of reasoning is to offer an *opportunity* to move towards accountability by exposing the function (or lack thereof) of the self, intention, knowledge.

Police officers cannot be held accountable until they understand that they are in the wrong. Indictments are important for *instilling* this understanding and rectifying the brutal arrogance that comes with impunity, but an indictment alone cannot provide that understanding. A convicted officer recieves punishment, but this is not the same as being held accountable. Until we get to that point, punishment is just another ordeal; a threat on blue lives. It is something suffered for the cause, and I fear that such suffering actually increases in-group loyalty: it mobilizes the police; it arms and armors them.

We need not be worried that this will be an exact mirror image of the BLM movement and the way each tradgedy reinforces it. The police cannot organize in the same way; their situation is not the same; their history is not the same. And their inability to organize betrays that---in some remote way---they understand this difference. This is where true knowledge can arise.

Police departments cannot be held accountable until they are brought to an understanding of their role in systematic racism. America cannot be held accountable until it understands its history. Demands for accountability might be good teaching tools, but until the understanding is there, that is all they are.

[[most relevant to Kierkegaard: we need to hold specific people accountable for their specific actions, to call judgement down on all these individual heads. But unless we have first provided a *context*---tied these particular actions into the web of history that is American racism---then we cannot call judgement on America: we cannot implicate and hold systemic racism accountable *through* these particular accountabilities.]]

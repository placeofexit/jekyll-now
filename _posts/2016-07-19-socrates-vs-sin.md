### Background

There is an ancient dilemma in ethical philosophy which has persisted to this day, and wormed its way into the language and politics of American racism. It can be characterized as the result of two competing and deeply-ingrained interpretive frameworks, corresponding more or less to the Socratic and Christian views on what constitutes *wrong action*:

This dynamic of two competing, incompatible interpretive frameworks underlies all of our normative talk and our attempts to actually address injustice. 

------------

#### Socrates
No person *knowingly* does wrong; true knowledge that something is wrong procludes any interest in it. Therefore, what appears to be malice is in fact ignorance of what is good, which results from an ignorance of the nature of one's soul.

This framework emphasizes **reasoning** as the means of moral reform; calling on the wrongdoer to **examine** their error.

--------------

#### Christianity
We are all in sin, and sin is a state of *knowingly* rejecting truth and the good. Individual sins are acts in which one *knowingly does wrong*, or else fails to do what one knows to be right.

This framework emphasizes **accountability** as the means of moral reform; calling on the wrongdoer to **repent**. <!--more-->

--------------

This is, of course, a simple summary of two very long and convoluted traditions. More can be (and has been) said on either side, but for the sake of expediency, I invite you to consider them as laid out.

In their barest form, these ethical frameworks are *incompatible* with one another. One cannot endorse them both at once, and---going by the principle of non-contradiction---neither can one employ their dictates simultaneously. One might use each of them *in turn* to illuminate a single situation, but at some point one must make the transition, from reasoning to accountability or vice versa.

So how do we choose which framework to employ? We cannot even ask which is *better* without accepting some rules for determining value, which already commits us to some interpretive scheme. Each framework, naturally enough, interprets itself more favorably, which creates a critical problem: whoever finds themselves called under judgement by either the Christian or the Socratic needs only hold fast to the other to escape moral reform via interpretive stalemate.

[Let's flesh out this dynamic through a concrete example.]

### The Woman at the Theater

We can find this dynamic underlying many of Ta-Nehisi Coates's concerns in *Between the World and Me*: namely, are the racists of America aware of their racism as such? Do they permit and perpetuate racial injustice because they have self-consciously embraced it, or are they simply ignorant? I see these questions of racism as analogous to the broader questions of *wrong action* [evil?] that the Socratic and Christian frameworks raise. The same dilemma is present here, as the answer to these questions affects the way we address racial injustice, and how we approach the task of uprooting racism---that is, of moral reform.

There is one story in particular that I would like to focus on, in which Coates self-consciously considers this issue. In the story, he has just taken his four-year-old son to see *Howl's Moving Castle* at a movie theater in the Upper West Side. Coming out, his son lingers at the bottom of a crowded escalator a little too long, until a white woman shoves him from behind. "Come on!" Coates confronts her---"hot with all of the moment and all of my history" (p.94)---but the crowd sides with the woman. Tensions escalate and the story culminates in a white man telling Coates, "I could have you arrested!"

Coates lingers on this story longer than usual, noting how this threat of arrest fits into a history of white claims over the black body. But his most lenghty (and for our purposes, his most relevant) discussion concerns how he might have communicated this to the woman that pushed his son. He wants to explain the context of her actions, to reason with her Socratically, but anticipates failure:

>Had I informed this woman that when she pushed my son, she was acting according to a tradition that held black bodies as lesser, her response would likely have been, "I am not racist." Or maybe not. But my experience in this world has been that the people who believe themselves to be white are obsessed with the politics of personal exoneration. And the word racist, to them, conjures, if not a tobacco-spitting oaf, then something just as fantastic---an orc, troll, or gorgon (97).

Here, we see a way in which, one could say, the Christian framework turns to thwart the proper functioning of the Socratic: we open with the Socratic, but the wrong-doer receives the Christian---an accusation that they deliberately harbor contempt---and responds accordingly. I believe Coates is right in suspecting this kind of discourse to be unproductive.

This pattern is a general one, though it seems especially common in racially-charged encounters because of the history of these "politics of personal exoneration." Coates lists examples that span the entire twentieth century, from Michael Richards to Strom Thurmond to the segregationists of Levittown, PA. In each case, white Americans, whose actions clearly fit the structure and function of white supremacy, manage to ward off any such associations by maintaining their innocent intentions. The force of this is not in *refuting* a claim---for these people's *intentions* had not been called into question---but in refuting what is *not* claimed and thereby shifting to a framework in which the original claim makes no sense.
[[if not later: "there was no golden era when evildoers did their business and loudly proclaimed it as such" (p.98)]]

In response to the Socratic, the Christian claims innocence: "I'm not racist." It response to the Christian, the Socratic claims *ignorance*: "*that's* not racist." Coates does not give a concrete example of this latter dynamic, though we will see how he addresses it soon. For now, one can think of various convenient cases of color-blindness, and how they function to derail demands for accountability. The Socratic undermines the Christian by claiming that "this is not a race issue," that the *real* issue is something else: black-on-black crime, or perhaps "freedom of speech."

**So the question here is: how to effectively address racial injustice---as simple as a white woman pushing a black child in a crowded theater---such that our efforts are not subverted by the ever-shifting ethical frameworks that underlie them?**

[[the primary question seems to be: how aware is this woman of her racism? is her denial genuine? addressing it follows.  would end the section with: I would now like to consider each framework on its own terms]]

### In Favor of the Socratic

One possible answer stands in favor of the Socratic framework, and I would say this is the more prominent position among politically-conscious young people today. On this view, the Christian framework---the idea that wrong acts are inherently bound up with knowledge or (what amounts to the same) intention---is precisely the problem. By locating the criterion for injustice in the heart of the perpetrator, the Christian framework actually grants them *privileged access* to it. Without an omniscient God to peer into their soul, this move subjects any claims against perpetrators to an [unreasonable and frankly] insurmountable doubt, since, as Coates warns his son, "there was no golden era when evildoers did their business and loudly proclaimed it as such" (p.98). The plausibility of the Christian framework is precisely why one can say "I'm not racist" with any kind of authority.

Accordingly, we can salvage our talk of "racism" from the realm of orcs and gorgons by focusing on concrete actions and regarding any recourse to intention as a distraction. Proponents of this view might hold that, actually, *all* white people are racist, while amending racism to mean "unconsciously participating in systems that oppress people of color." By emphasizing the way that people's actions fit into historical patterns and affect current structures of power, they endeavor to shift popular consciousness from the impossible ideal of *intentional* racism (which cannot be seen or spoken of) to the concrete structures of *systematic* racism.

Now, it may be the case that wrong actions always involve *some* sort of knowledge or awareness; after all, one needs to have a certain sense of what one is doing in order to competently do it. We can see this kind of knowledge at play in Coates' account of the woman at the theater:

>There was my sense that this woman was pulling rank. I knew, for instance, that she would not have pushed a black child out on my part of Flatbush, because she would be afraid there and would sense, if not know, that there would be a penalty for such an action (94).

One might read this and object that this woman's very act of "pulling rank" *demonstrates* an awareness of that rank. Since, in this context, that rank is constituted by skin color, does that mean that this woman is already aware of her racism---that her denial is a plain-faced lie?

It is worth emphasizing that when the Socratic denies the possibility of knowingly or intentionally doing wrong, it has in mind a very particular kind of knowledge. The person that holds such *Socratic knowledge* must be both aware of it and able to articulate it,[^2](Consider Socrates' many interlocutors who claim to know the meaning of virtue, yet fail to articulate it without self-contradiction. Consider also the slave boy of the [*Meno*](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1643/1643-h/1643-h.htm), who is perfectly able to articulate the Pythagorean Theorem, yet was not aware of this ability prior to Socrates' intervention. In a certain sense, Socrates does take this boy's innate capacity as proof of his mathematical knowledge. Yet if we are all like this boy---knowing everything there is to know through the eternal transmigration of our souls---then this unrecollected knowledge cannot satisfy the condition of "knowingly doing wrong." Proper Socratic knowledge must be forged in the dialectic.) which is not the case with the woman at the theater. The sensing-if-not-knowing that Coates sees here is a very unrefined kind of knowledge, which would not pass muster for Socratic knowledge proper. Socrates calls this *unrecollected* knowledge: knowledge that we have forgotten that we know.

Far from discrediting the Socratic framework, unrecollected knowledge is central to its method of moral reform. Unlike intention, it is not hidden in one's hearts, but is made plain in the implications of one's beliefs and actions. Rather than *lecture* his interlocutors, Socrates need only *articulate* what they already know. They may not particularly *like* to have their views clarified in this way, but if Socrates does his job well, then they should recognize these views as their own. If they do---if they assent, admitting that yes indeed, Socrates has understood them well---then they have already forfeited the authority of Christian interiority, and so retired from the politics of self-exhoneration. 

It is tempting, faced simultaneously with repugnant beliefs and the believer's vulnerability, to make for the Christian and level an accusation. Yet if one holds fast to the Socratic, then one continues to depersonalize the question of racism, moving from this interlocutor's underlying assumptions to the structural realities that those depend on. White Americans must already sense (if they do not yet *know*) the pervasive fabric of systemic racism (else they would not be so good at playing it to their advantage) and this is precisely what one endeavors to remind them of. If a little Socratic interrogation could bring the woman at the theater to admit that "no, I would not have pushed a black child out on your part of Flatbush," then it's a short step to the real issue: "Yes, I suppose that I 'outrank' Coates in the Upper West Side. Yes, I suppose this is what allows me to push his son with impunity. Yes, this 'rank' is only afforded to me by a long history of racial injustice, and by exercising it, I am perpetuating that injustice."

We might worry that, even confronted such a weighty recollection, what's to stop this woman from simply embracing her racism? Have we not also shown her that, as a white person, perpetuating this systemic injustice is in her own self-interest?

In the *Gorgias*, Socrates argues that this would not be a rational response, we all consider it worse to commit an injustice than to suffer one. This echoes Coates' pessimistic line that evildoers never proclaim their evil, yet that basic interest in self-exoneration, which previously caused us such trouble, here becomes a great moral advantage. If the woman at the theater can be brought to acknowledge the systematic *injustice* inherent in her actions, we can expect her to reject it, even at great cost to herself. Socrates' reasoning here can get quite technical, so I will simply suggest that it bears out in experience: the closest contemporary phenomenon to a shameless embrace of racism---the alt-right movement---still needs to *justify* itself, hence the practice of "red-pilling," casting people of color as the oppressors and white Americans as oppressed.[^1](White supremacy, like all systems of hate, is not coherent by itself. It is always parasitic upon other ideologies, appropriating their values---be they family and country or progress and equality---to its own purposes.)

It is *this* that must be challenged; the rest will follow. And critical to challenging it is recognizing it for what it is---ignorance, a set of false beliefs---and doing away with the misleading and unproductive notion of a deeper intention or malice.

### From the Christian Perspective

[[MAYBE somewhere in here:
>But this obstinancy of truth certainly is not respected; likewise, it is far from being the case that men regard the relationship to truth, relating themselves to the truth, as the highest good, and it is very far from being the case that they Socratically regard being in error in this manner as the worst misfortune---the sensate in them usually far outweighs their intellectuality. For example, if a man is presumably happy, imagines himself to be happy, although considered in the light of truth he is unhappy, he is usually far from wanting to be wrenched out of his error. On the contrary, he becomes indignant, he regards anyone who does so as his worst enemy, he regards it as an assault bordering on murder in the sense that, as is said, it murders his happiness (43).
]]]

We have just characterized the Christian framework as naive in the face of history. The Christian similarly regards the Socratic as naive, but with respect to human nature. "Of course evildoers have never *proclaimed* themselves as such," it admits, "but this does not mean that they have not understood (or, at least, willfully *mis*understood) the nature of their actions."

Though the Socratic speaks of sin as a kind of malice or contempt (and perhaps this is the only alternative to ignorance that the Socratic can conceive of), what the Christian framework intends is something much more passive. It starts with what Augustine calls "willful ignorance:"

>It is one thing to be ignorant, and another thing to be unwilling to know. For the will is at fault in the case of the man of whom it is said, "He is not inclined to understand, so as to do good" (*On Grace and Free Will*, chpt. V).

Coates calls those "not inclined to understand" the *Dreamers*, who both cultivate the American myth and enjoy its [strange] fruit. Theirs is not the simple ignorance of those watching the shadows in Plato's cave, but the willful ignorance of those who *do* understand the distinction between illusion and reality and yet do not *care*. The Christian framework contends that the vast majority of human ignorance is of this sort. It does not arise through a firm commitment to the truth (tragically led astray by false beliefs), but through *convenience*---that is, a *negative commitment*, a total lack of commitment.[^2](This explains the parasitic nature of white supremacy: it is first and foremost an absence (a *lack* of commitment) and absence requires something to be absent from. It needs a positive system of values with respect to which it can manifest. These values can take many forms, but fundamental to all of them (and to the possibility of maintaining positive values at all) is the commitment to truth and the good. This is why we have characterized white supremacy's lack as one with respect to truth: it is the most basic and general form of sin---the sin *state*---on which all particular sins are then founded.)

We can think of this negative commitment as a kind of drowsiness or lethargy, which is necessary but insufficient for dreaming, just as willful ignorance is necessary but insufficient for sin. To get sin, we need an *opportunity* for wakefulness, which the sinner then turns down, like a half-awake person squinting and shielding her eyes from sunlight. Here,  the will transitions from weakness to *defiance*. The dreamer *refuses* to wake up, even as she begins to understand that she *is* waking up. This is because the morning presents itself to the dreamer as a kind of death, rendering her dream's narrative incoherent and mocking the passion with which she pursued its dream-goods. It natural for the dreamer to curse the morning for ending her dream-pursuits prematurely.[^3](Of course, morning's reflection finds this behavior completely absurd. The dream-narrative has no end of its own. It leads the dreamer on a merry chase as stories follow from stories, each task forgotten before it can be completed. The awakened person can make no sense of it---though most, with no further reflection, move right on with their waking narrative and real-life tasks, which surely must have an end in sight!)

Coates seems to recognize this kind of behavior in the Dreamers, as he practically accuses them of dreaming lucidly:

>The mettle that it takes to look away from the horror of our prison system, from police forces transformed into armies, from the long war against the black body, is not forged overnight. This is the practiced habit of jabbing out one’s eyes and forgetting the work of one’s hands (p.98).

Such "practiced habits" are precisely why the Christian framework insists on the role of *knowledge* in sin and injustice. Insofar as the will is active and defiant, it is impossible to will ignorance completely; the very act of "jabbing out one's eyes" betrays an awareness of what one might otherwise see. Yet since most ignorance *is* of the willful sort, the Christian considers what the Socratic called "unrecollected knowledge" to be something more like a *repressed memory*. It jumps at every opportunity to re-emerge and is only kept at bay through willful intervention (even if that intervention itself is later obscured and forgotten). Slowly, the Dreamers' noncommittal dreaming becomes less convenient and approaches the realm of deliberate, self-conscious activity. They must plan and stage their forgetting in advance to be ready when the memory next emerges. But this transition is so subtle that, in most cases, the old habits forged by convenience are sufficient to carry one though it (and into sin) without fuss or fanfare.

In light of all of this, the Christian framework regards the Socratic program of rational deliberation as fundamentally misguided. While the Socratic endeavors to remind the Dreamers of their unrecollected knowledge of systematic racism, the Dreamers' entire project has anticipated this, and slipping into the Christian interpretive frame is but one way of preserving their ignorance. The woman at the theater is not closed off to Coates's imagined dialogue because she (innocently enough) *confuses* an explanation with an accusation, but because she *chooses* to take it this way. Her confusion is more convenient than recollecting that uncomfortable knowledge, hidden behind her "pulling rank," which threatens to throw her actions and whole way of life into question.

Until this changes---until the Dreamers take *responsibility* for their dreaming---reasoning with them is actually impossible. They may nod and make noises like they understand, but this is ultimately a false act. It is no different from how they imitate the noises and movements of the oppressed, appropriating the language of discrimination and silencing, or demanding safe spaces to dream in. We are lucky if, convinced that it is making progress reasoning with the Dreamers, the Socratic merely accomplishes nothing. Yet it may actually enable their dreaming, when---blind to the workings of the will---it accepts their account of white supremacy as a faceless force of nature, from which no agents emerge accountable.[^4](I might suggest that the Socratic risks this when it loses a healthy sense of *irony*. Irony is the only thing allowing Socrates to practice his method without being actually deceived by his interlocutors.)

Forgoing dialogue, the Christian framework calls on the Dreamers to *repent*. They *know* what they do, and the only hope is to appeal to this knowledge---to demand an admission, if not an apology. It is a slim hope to be sure, that an accusation might break through their charade and strike at their guilty heart, but alas, there is only so much that one can do for another in matters of the will. At the end of the day, the Christian framework demands a great deal from the individual Dreamer, placing the onus of education and moral reform squarely on his shoulders. One can present the Dreamers with a choice---one can call on them to "wake up!"---but one cannot make that choice for them. At a certain point, one can only pray.

### Synthesis

The careful reader may have already noticed that the Christian's hands-off approach to moral reform is strikingly similar to what the Socratic initially took issue with: the way that the Christian empowers wrongdoers and racists by granting them privileged access to their intention and their moral bearing. This method is precisely *why* the Socratic believes that the phenomenon of shifting frameworks (in the form of the politics of personal exoneration) so plagues its efforts. Meanwhile, the Christian accuses the Socratic of allowing wrongdoers and racists to slip across frameworks by blinding itself to the self-conscious acts of the will that drive this evasive behavior. So, one method of moral reform is the bane of another.

I initially set up the Christian and Socratic ethical frameworks as opposite interpretive extremes. We can now see that, from the perspective of each, the other responsible for the phenomenon of shifting frameworks that plagues both of their efforts.

-----------------

[[Coates shows how both are problematic]]

If we hold fast to the Christian, insisting on the role of intention in systematic racism, then we set the stage for the politics of personal exoneration.

KEY: The Christian framework, in its extreme, produces the problematic understanding of racism as a *character trait*, something fundamental and impossible to reconcile with systematic oppression. This [[politics of personal exoneration]]

[[Coate's quote on orcs and gorgons goes here?]]

The Socratic, in its extreme, produces the view of racism as a natural phenomenon, where lynchings are carried out by "persons unknown" and _outrageous_ acts become mere _tragedies_. Coates attributes much of our shrugged acceptance of racialized-violence to this kind of race-fatalism:

>The earthquake cannot be subpoenaed. The typhoon will not bend under indictment. They sent the killer of Prince Jones back to his work, because he was not a killer at all. He was a force of nature, the helpless agent of our world’s laws (p.83).

---------------
The two frameworks only point their finger at each other. And still we are faced with the question of how to respond to the woman at the theater.

Before proceeding further, I must admit that I am entirely in debt to S&#248;ren Kierkegaard, and especially his *Philosophical Fragments*, for first setting out the Socratic and Christian frameworks in an either/or relationship of mutual oposition.

In many respects, the *Fragments* offers a very standard Christian account of evil, emphasizing sin and the role of the will. The Socratic is subordinated to the Christian *telos* of *faith*, not something to be pursued in its own right. Yet within Kierkegaard's (Christian) framework, the Socratic still has a role to play.

For Kierkegaard, as for Socrates, rational discourse is *necessary* for moral reform. It is not sufficient, as no amount of reason can bring about a reversal of the will, but it is needed in order to *expose* the role of the will. It is necessary, and---most interesting for our purposes---it is *prior* to repentance. Dialogue, for Kierkegaard, preceeds any possibility of accountability.

The structure looks roughly like this: sin is, as we have said, a state of untruth, of actively rejecting the truth, and this is a choice, not a confusion. Truth (reason and Socratic dialogue) cannot be used to rectify untruth, since it has already been rejected; one needs repentance and the grace of the absurd. Yet it *can* be used to articulate or *draw attention to* one's sin state---that is, by showing the sinner that they *are* actively rejecting the truth---making impossible the excuse of innocence.

>"If I had not come and spoken unto them, they would not have sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin" (John 15:22).
[maybe?]

[[quote from fragments]]

This is the best that a mere human can do for another, and for Kierkegaard, Socrates is the best of all mere humans.

In emphasizing the spiritual and transformative limits of the rational discourse, Kierkegaard finds himself in good company. The possibility of failed dialogue was a central concern for Plato. We can see this concern embodied in two of his most infamous characters: Callicles of the *Gorgias* and Thrasymachus of the *Republic*. When Socrates points out contradictions in their views, they embrace them, taking the opportunity to deride his method as childish and unrealistic. In both cases, Socrates and his interlocutors resolve nothing; rather than *aporia*, they part in frustration and confusion. And yet the failure does not seem to be on Socrates' part, but rather on his interlocutors. They do not proceed to dialogue from a desire to learn, but rather from a desire to *refute*---and perhaps, to *exonerate* themselves from Socrates' accusations.
[[Maybe better: emphasize likeness to the Dreamers, not trying to learn truth, or not respecting the method of acquiring truth, but assuming what is convenient.]]
[[They embrace irrationalism for the same reason that the Dreamers embrace the shifting frameworks: it neutralizes the genuine threat that the Socratic brings.]]

[[For Kierkegaard, the concern is more dire, as this is sin, and we are *all* in sin. Through it, one trades the love of others for love of oneself, and, turning inward, eventually becomes unreceptive to the love of others---in which the loving engagement of others must be repeatedly rejected in order to maintain the absolute rightness of one's own atomic self.[^5](That I am rendering "God's love" or "Christ's love" here as the "love of others" will, I hope, not throw my readers off the central point: that the *attitude* required for rejecting these loves is one and the same. Any written or unwritten theological theories as to the identity of the love of others with the love of God, while exciting, need not distract us from the task at hand.)]]

Kierkegaard's solution rests upon the Christian framework's notion that maintaining oneself in sin---sustaining one's dream---requires a constant and deliberate application of effort, and that one cannot be entirely unaware of such effort. The Dreamers succeed in their ritual repression---they might endeavor to forget the reality of systematic racism, and, indeed, *actually* forget it. But now they must forget this last act of forgetting, and so on and so on. There is always something, somewhere down the line that remains unrecollected. In this infinite regress, the Dreamers cannot fully will ignorance, and...

somewhere down the line, the Dreamers' dreaming must still be apparent in their present activity of will. So, by engaging them in rational discourse, one forces their will into action---and even if their will labors against the truth, *this itself* reveals the truth---this itself *is* a kind of recollection. One forces them to confront their willful practice of forgetting by forcing them to *perform* it, and one does *this* with rational discourse.

[[, and this last unburried action is precisely what the *opportunity* triggers, what theatens to bring the truth of the whole endeavor surging back into awareness.]]

####The Actual Solution

It's important to note Kierkegaard's method does not necessarily yield Socratic knowledge about one's sin state. As in the *Gorgias* Socrates never *convinces* Callicles through rational argument that he is in untruth, but he continues to engage him in dialogue *so as to forcibly draw his attention to it*---so as to make the active denial of truth, reason and the good (which is always active) *explicit*, so as to make it an issue and force it into consideration. Success here is not important; one does not need to convert the racist crowd. One engages in this way purely out of love (*eros*) [may need to define or set up earlier], as Socrates did. This is what it means to love your enemy: to [[Coates quote? might work]]

>History is not soley in our hands. And still you are called to struggle, not because it assures you victory but because it assures you an honorable and sane life (p.97).

[new idea here: this method is agnostic about whether a given case of ignorance is willful or accidental. otherwise, repetitive.]
In either case [[failed or successful reasoning]], this act *shows* the other their error, their sin. If their intention was involved in it (if they sinned), then they will not be able to accept this; racism (like sin) must obscure its own activity in order to propperly (or impropperly) operate. If their intention was not there---if their belief was truly unexamined---then they may be more open to it. But *in either case*, the key function of reasoning is to offer an *opportunity* to move towards accountability by exposing the function (or lack thereof) of the self/intention/knowledge in one's beliefs and actions.

>"If I had not come and spoken unto them, they would not have sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin" (John 15:22).

Kierkegaard's synthesis basically accepts the Christian *account* of ignorance, wrong action, and racism, while appropriating the Socratic *method* to that framework.

To the extent that the Christian method (calling for repentance) is valid here, I believe it is, again, only so far as Kierkegaard understands it; that is, by repenting first oneself. To repent is to disclose one's sin publicly, to acknowledge the difficulty of waking up, of becoming vulnerable before the truth. And by disclosing oneself, we invite others to disclose themselves. [is this discourse? if so, need to say] For Kierkegaard, then, the Socratic method is fundamentally the best means of achieving the Christian solution, of bringing others to repent.
[[tho in this context that cannot apply to people of color, who do not necessarily have to repent of the same thing]]

>"If I had not come and spoken unto them, they would not have sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin" (John 15:22).

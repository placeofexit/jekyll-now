### Background

There is an ancient dilemma in ethical philosophy which has persisted to this day, and wormed its way into the language and politics of American racism. It can be characterized as the result of two competing and deeply-ingrained interpretive frameworks: the Socratic and the Christian.

------------

#### Socrates
No person *knowingly* does wrong; true knowledge that something is wrong procludes any interest in it. Therefore, what appears to be malice is in fact ignorance, and this ignorance is primarily an ignorance of the nature of one's soul.

This framework emphasizes **reasoning** as the means of moral reform; calling on the wrongdoer to **examine** their error.

--------------

#### Christianity
We are all in sin, and sin is a state of *knowingly* rejecting truth and the good. Individual sins are acts in which one *knowingly does wrong*, or else fails to do what one knows to be right.

This framework emphasizes **accountability** as the means of moral reform; calling on the wrongdoer to **repent**. <!--more-->

--------------

This is, of course, a simplification of two very long and convoluted traditions. More can be (and has been) said on either side, but for the sake of expediency, I invite you to consider them as laid out.

In their barest form, these ethical frameworks are *incompatible* with one another. One cannot endorse them both at once, and---going by the principle of non-contradiction---neither can one employ their dictates simultaneously. One might use each of them *in turn* to illuminate a single situation, but at some point one must make the transition, from reasoning to accountability or vice versa.

### Ta-Nehisi Coates on this Dynamic

This dynamic of two competing, incompatible interpretive frameworks underlies all of our normative talk and our attempts to actually address injustice. As such, it's no coincidence to find it threaded throughout Ta-Nehisi Coates's *Between the World and Me*, and at the heart of one story in particular.

This story takes place in a movie theater in the Upper West Side, where Coates takes his son to see *Howl's Moving Castle*:

>The theater was crowded, and when we came out...you were moving at the dawdling speed of a small child. A white woman pushed you and said, "Come on!" (p.93-4).

Coates confronts her, "hot with all of the moment and all of my history." The crowd sides with the woman, tensions escalate, and the story culminates in a white man telling him, "I could have you arrested!"

Coates lingers on this story longer than usual, taking time to unpack the dynamics at play. There's the way the mostly-white Upper West Side renders his blackness in high-contrast. There's the way that history transforms a threat of arrest into a threat on his life. [[But then he begins to wonder how he might have communicated this to the woman that pushed his son; could he have brought her to see her own actions with all their historical coloring?]] More and more, his attention moves to the root of this situation...

[[introduce language of Dreamers in this last paragraph; issue at hand i: how can the Dreamers be woken up?]]

### The Problem

Coates considers the Socratic approach to the woman at the theater. He wants to explain the situation, to reason with her, but anticipates failure:

>Had I informed this woman that when she pushed my son, she was acting according to a tradition that held black bodies as lesser, her response would likely have been, "I am not racist." Or maybe not. But my experience in this world has been that the people who believe themselves to be white are obsessed with the politics of personal exoneration. And the word racist, to them, conjures, if not a tobacco-spitting oaf, then something just as fantastic---an orc, troll, or gorgon (97).

Here, we see a way in which, one could say, the Christian framework turns to thwart the proper functioning of the Socratic: we open with the Socratic, but the wrong-doer receives the Christian---an accusation that they deliberately harbor contempt---and responds accordingly. I believe Coates is right in suspecting this kind of discourse to be unproductive.

This pattern is a general one, though it seems especially common in racially-charged encounters, precisely because of the history of these "politics of personal exoneration." Coates lists examples that span the entire twentieth century, from Michael Richards to Strom Thurmond to the segregationists of Levittown, PA. In each case, white Americans, whose actions clearly fit the structure and function of white supremacy, manage to ward off all such associations by maintaining their innocent intentions, even when their *intentions* had not been called into question.

The force of this is not in *refuting* a claim, but in refuting what is *not* claimed; shifting to a framework in which the original claim makes no sense. In response to the Socratic, the Christian claims innocence: "I'm not racist." It response to the Christian, the Socratic claims *ignorance*: "*that's* not racist." Coates does not give a concrete example of this latter dynamic, though we will see how he addresses it soon. For now, one can think of various manifestations of race-blindness, and how they function to derail demands for accountability. The Socratic underlies claims that "this is not a race issue," or that the *real* issue is "freedom of speech."

So the question is: how to effectively address racial injustice---as simple as a white woman pushing a black child in a crowded theater---such that our efforts are not subverted by the ever-shifting ethical frameworks that establish them?

### In Favor of the Socratic

One possible solution stands in favor of the Socratic framework, and I would say this is the more prominent position among politically-conscious young people today. On this view, the Christian framework---the idea that wrong acts (sins) are inherently bound up in knowledge (or, what amounts to the same, *intention*)---is precisely the problem. It creates the confusion that results in shifting frameworks, by giving the claim "I'm not racist" such force. Locating the criterion for injustice in the heart of the perpetrator actually grants them *privileged access* to it. Without an omniscient God to peer into their soul, this move establishes plausible deniability for perpetrators and subjects any claims against them to an extraordinary and *un*reasonable doubt. It is unrealistic and misses the force of history: that, as Coates warns his son, "there was no golden era when evildoers did their business and loudly proclaimed it as such" (p.98).

Proponents of this view hope to salvage our talk of "racism" from the realm of orcs and gorgons by regarding any recourse to intention as a distraction. They might hold that, actually, *all* white people are racist, while amending racism to mean "unconsciously participating in structures that harm people of color." By emphasizing the way that people's actions fit into historical patterns and affect current structures of power, they are pushing popular consciousness from the impossible ideal of *intentional* racism (which cannot be seen or spoken of) to the concrete structures of *systemic* racism. [[feels a little disconnected from what follows...maybe this paragraph goes at the end?]]

This is not to deny the role of *some* sort of knowledge or intention in systemic racism and its specific manifestations. In the same story of the woman at the theater, Coates notes:

>There was my sense that this woman was pulling rank. I knew, for instance, that she would not have pushed a black child out on my part of Flatbush, because she would be afraid there and would sense, if not know, that there would be a penalty for such an action (94).

Yet this is a very unrefined kind of knowledge, this sensing-if-not-knowing. The Socratic framework can still admit of it, as it would not pass muster for proper Socratic knowledge, the kind at stake in the claim that nobody knowingly does wrong. Socrates calls it *unrecollected* knowledge: knowledge that we have forgotten that we know. We need help remembering, and no doubt a little bit of Socratic interrogation could bring this woman to remember that "no, I would not have pushed a black child out on your part of Flatbush."

Far from discrediting the Socratic framework, this kind of knowledge is critical to what it hopes to accomplish. Remember that Socrates does not *lecture* his interlocutors, but simply *points out* what they already know---the implications of their beliefs and actions---and brings them to acknowledge the truth in their own words. This approach is not immune to the politics of self-exoneration, but the hope is that the woman in the theater might be more willing to admit that she was "pulling rank" if the question of "racism" has first been dispelled or depersonalized.

From this small admission, it's a short step to the real issue: "where does that 'rank' come from? is it justified?" White Americans must already sense (if they do not yet *know*) the pervasive fabric of systemic racism, else they would not be so good at playing it to their advantage. Rather than *change* their worldview, we need only *show* them what their worldview entails.

Should we worry that, confronted with the reality of systemic racism, white Americans will simply embrace it? "You mean the world is set up in a way that I benefit at your expense? Sounds good to me!" 

[[also Coates: nobody openly declares their malice, could even put quote here]]

In the *Gorgias*, Socrates argues that this would not be a rational response: we all consider it worse to commit an injustice than to suffer one. If the woman at the theater can be brought to acknowledge the *systemic injustice* inherent in her actions, we can expect her to reject it, even at great cost to herself. The argument here can get quite technical, so I will simply suggest that it bears out in experience: the closest contemporary phenomenon to a shameless embrace of racism---the alt-right movement---still needs to *justify* itself, hence the practice of "red-pilling," casting people of color as the oppressors and white Americans as oppressed.[^1](White supremacy, like all systems of hate, is not coherent by itself. It is always parasitic upon other ideologies, appropriating their values---be they family and country or progress and equality---to its own purposes.)

It is *this* that must be challenged; the rest will follow. And critical to challenging it is recognizing it for what it is---ignorance, a set of false beliefs---and doing away with the misleading and unproductive idea that injustice must stem from a deeper intention or malice.

### In Favor of the Christian

We have just characterized the Christian framework as naive in the face of history, yet it is worth noting that it similarly regards the Socratic as naive, but with respect to human nature. "Of course evildoers have never *proclaimed* themselves as such," it admits, "but this does not mean that they have not understood (or, at least, willfully *mis*understood) the nature of their actions."

Though the Socratic understands sin as a kind of malice or contempt (and perhaps this is the only alternative to ignorance that the Socratic can conceive of), what the Christian framework intends is something much more passive. It begins with what Augustine calls "willful ignorance:"

>It is one thing to be ignorant, and another thing to be unwilling to know. For the will is at fault in the case of the man of whom it is said, "He is not inclined to understand, so as to do good" (*On Grace and Free Will*, chpt. V).

This is not the simple ignorance of those watching the shadows in Plato's cave, but of those who *do* understand the distinction between illusion and reality and yet do not *care*. Coates calls those "not inclined to understand" the *Dreamers*, who both cultivate the American myth and enjoy [partake of] its strange fruit.

Contrary to the Socratic, the Christian contends that most of human ignorance is the result of this unwillingness. The Dreamers do not arrive at their ignorance through a firm commitment to the truth (tragically led astray by false beliefs), but through *convenience*---that is, a negative commitment, a total lack of commitment.[^2](This explains the parasitic nature of white supremacy: it is first and foremost an absence (a *lack* of commitment) and absence requires something to be absent from. It needs a positive system of values with respect to which it can manifest. These values can take many forms, but fundamental to all of them (and to the possibility of maintaining positive values at all) is the commitment to truth and the good. This is why we have characterized white supremacy's lack as one with respect to truth: it is the most basic and general form of sin---the sin state---on which all particular sins are then founded.) Their allegiance is neither to truth nor falsehood, but simply to whatever sustains their dreaming; any consideration for truth comes after the fact, as a means of justification.

This is the *negative commitment* that characterizes the Dreamers. We can think of it as a kind of drowsiness or lethargy, which allows one to fall into and enjoy the dream narrative. 

The Christian framework calls this the *sin state*, which is necessary but insufficient for sin. To get sin, the *possibility* of wakefulness, which comes as a prod from the woke world that interrupts the innocence of sleep. When sin then arises, it can be thought of as the half-awake squinting and shielding of eyes from sunlight, or the batting away of the alarm clock. This is the transition from laziness, a mere weakness of the will, to *defiance*. For one in a dream, reality is a kind of death. Before the morning renders the dream incoherent and mocks the passion with which the dreamer pursued its dream-goods---when waking life is just seeping in---the dreamer clings to the narrative of her dream and curses the morning for ending it prematurely. She *refuses* to wake up, even as she begins to understand that she *is* waking up.

Coates seems to acknowledge this kind of behavior, as he practically accuses the Dreamers of dreaming lucidly:

>The mettle that it takes to look away from the horror of our prison system, from police forces transformed into armies, from the long war against the black body, is not forged overnight. This is the practiced habit of jabbing out one’s eyes and forgetting the work of one’s hands (p.98).

This "practiced habit" is precisely why the Christian framework insists on the role of *knowledge* in sin and injustice. As much as the dream is a kind of willful ignorance, it is impossible to will ignorance completely. The very act of "jabbing out one's eyes" betrays an awareness of what one might otherwise see. We are not dealing with a mere lack of curiosity or intellectual sincerity, but an active project of forgetting.

The Christian framework views what the Socratic calls "unrecollected knowledge" as the result of this project. This knowledge is not *simply* forgotten, the way one forgets a pair of keys or a lover's voice; no, this knowledge is more akin to a *repressed memory*. It jumps at every opportunity to re-emerge, and it is precisely this behavior that prompts the dreamers' ritual repression. Gradually, their dreaming becomes less convenient---it must be planned and staged in advance---and their noncommittal dreaming approaches the realm of deliberate activity. But this transition is so subtle that, in most cases, the old habits forged by convenience are sufficient to carry one though it and into sin, with no one taking notice.

As such, the Christian framework offers a very different interpretation of the woman at the theater (and with her, the problem of shifting frameworks itself). She is not closed off to Coates's imagined dialogue because she (innocently enough) *confuses* an explanation with an accusation, but because she *chooses* to take it this way. We should not mistake her turn to the Christian as a confusion *caused by* the Christian (or worse still, a conversion experience!). Her confusion is more convenient than recollecting that uncomfortable knowledge, hidden behind her "pulling rank," which threatens to throw her actions and whole way of life into question. She has only forgotten it by choice, and she continues to forget it by choice.

So, naturally enough, the Christian framework regards the Socratic program of rational deliberation as fundamentally misguided. This project cannot even *begin* unless there is some *positive* commitment (to truth), something to override the convenience of self-exoneration. Until this changes---until the Dreamers take *responsibility* for their dreaming---reasoning with them is impossible. They may nod and make noises like they understand, but this is ultimately a false act, no different from how they imitate the noises and movements of the oppressed. Each is convenient in different ways and at different times.

Too often, the Socratic framework falls for the false act, interpreting it with at least equal charity and genuineness as superficially similar acts by people of color: claims of discrimination and silencing, demands for safe spaces, etc. [[confusing!]] Perhaps the Socratic simply sees these acts as ignorant, yet sometimes the Socratic goes further, assuming it's *own* ignorance, possibly concluding that oppression is an obscure matter of subjective impressions, and with that, slowly joining the Dreamers in their fantasy.

Instead, the Christian framework proposes

Solution: dreamers not reachable through conventional methods (they so love their dream), but *because* they know, somewhere in there, that they are dreaming, they can be held accountable. They knowingly do wrong, and so are *guilty*. The Christian framework views white America as guilty of white supremacy, and calls on white America to *repent*.

### Synthesis

I previously set up the Christian and Socratic ethical frameworks as opposite extremes, and we can see that from the perspective of each, the other is at fault. Through Coates, we can see that *both* extremes are problematic. The Christian cannot *help* but grant some validity to claims of innocence ("I'm not racist"), just as the Socratic cannot *help* but take claimed ignorance at face value, as the result of sincere (but tragically false) beliefs.

[Both vanish the concrete instances of racism....]



Yet ignoring the role of intention in systematic and discrete racism seems just as problematic as insisting upon it. To ignore the role of intention is, in a way, to conceed to the account of white supremacy as a faceless force of nature, from which no agents emerge accountable. Here, lynchings are carried out by "persons unknown," and _outrageous_ acts become mere _tragedies_. Coates attributes much of our shrugged acceptance of racialized-violence to this kind of race-fatalism:
 
>The earthquake cannot be subpoenaed. The typhoon will not bend under indictment. They sent the killer of Prince Jones back to his work, because he was not a killer at all. He was a force of nature, the helpless agent of our world’s laws (p.83).

This is the way in which the Socratic framework *depersonalizes* what had been a demand for accountability.

---------------
The two frameworks only point the finger at each other. And still we are faced with the question of how to respond to the woman at the theater.

I am entirely in debt to S&#248;ren Kierkegaard for the formulation of the two frameworks as given above. Ironically, in seeking to distance philosophy from Christianity, he clarified their relationship in such a way as to finally bring them into authentic contact.
As much as his work brings the Christian and Socratic into an either/or opposition, in the process of establishing this he 

For that, I would like to turn to the work of S&#248;ren Kierkegaard, namely his *Philosophical Fragments*. We have, in the *Fragments*, a strange synthesis, where both frameworks function in the propper development of a single spiritual ideal.

Kierkegaard's synthesis, while similar to the Christian framework in all the key points, offers us at least one practical insight that the original framework does not. For Kierkegaard, as for Socrates, dialogue, reasoning, and education are *necessary* for moral reform. They are not sufficient, as reasoning in itself is not atonement---no amount of reason can bring about a reversal of the will, but it is necessary to *expose* the role of the will. It is necessary, and---most interesting for our purposes---it is *prior* to repentance. Dialogue, for Kierkegaard, preceeds any possibility of accountability.

The structure looks roughly like this: sin is, as we have said, a state of untruth, of actively rejecting the truth, and this is a choice, not a confusion. Truth (reason and Socratic dialogue) cannot be used to rectify untruth, since it has already been rejected; one needs repentance and the grace of the absurd. Yet it *can* be used to articulate or *draw attention to* one's sin state---that is, by showing the sinner that they *are* actively rejecting the truth---making impossible the excuse of innocence.

Anti-Climacus on *being ignorant of being in despair* (i.e. being ignorant of one's sin state, the thing that Socrates can help with).

>But this obstinancy of truth certainly is not respected; likewise, it is far from being the case that men regard the relationship to truth, relating themselves to the truth, as the highest good, and it is very far from being the case that they Socratically regard being in error in this manner as the worst misfortune---the sensate in them usually far outweighs their intellectuality. For example, if a man is presumably happy, imagines himself to be happy, although considered in the light of truth he is unhappy, he is usually far from wanting to be wrenched out of his error. On the contrary, he becomes indignant, he regards anyone who does so as his worst enemy, he regards it as an assault bordering on murder in the sense that, as is said, it murders his happiness (43).

>Yet ignorance is so far from breaking the despair or changing despair to nondespair that it can in fact be the most dangerous form of despair. To his own demoralization, the individual who in ignorance is in despair is in a way secured against becoming aware---that is, he is altogether secure in the power of despair (p.44).


This is the best that a mere human can do for another, and for Kierkegaard, Socrates is the best of all mere humans.

There's reason to think that Kierkegaard is actually drawing on and expanding what was a central concern for Plato: the possibility of failed dialogue. We can see this embodied in two of his most infamous characters: Callicles of the *Gorgias* and Thrasymachus of the *Republic*. When Socrates points out contradictions in their views, they embrace them, taking the opportunity to deride his method as childish and unrealistic. In both cases, Socrates and his interlocutors resolve nothing; rather than *aporia*, they part in frustration and confusion. And yet the failure does not seem to be on Socrates' part, but rather on his interlocutors. They do not proceed to dialogue from a desire to learn, but rather from a desire to *refute*---and perhaps, to *exhonerate* themselves from Socrates' accusations.

For Kierkegaard, the concern is more dire, as this is where Christianity sees *all* of us. While it has otherwise been called "idle talk" (Heidegger) or "bullshit" (LOOKUP), this state is in fact *sin*; it is the state in which one trades love of others for love of oneself, and in doing so, turns inward and arrives at a place in which one is unreceptive to the love of others---in which the loving engagement of others must be repeatedly rejected in order to maintain the absolute rightness of one's own atomic self.[^3](That I am rendering "God's love" or "Christ's love" as the "love of others" will, I hope, not throw my readers off the central point: that the *attitude* required for rejecting these loves is one and the same. Any written or unwritten theological theories as to the identity of the love of others with the love of God, while exciting, need not distract us from the task at hand.)

Kierkegaard's solution rests upon the notion that maintaining oneself in this state (of untruth) requires a constant and deliberate application of effort. The sinner repeatedly chooses her sin. Necessary in this, there is *some* knowledge or covert awareness that one is willfully refusing love, choosing untruth, hearing what they want to hear. White Americans do not deny the reality of racism in America out of true belief, but out of a (tacitly understood, vaguely grasped) sense that one will benefit from denying it. The politics of personal exoneration are not concerned with uncovering the true structure of our society; this structure simply doesn’t play a part in the claims (and even genuine fears!) of the ‘attack on white America.’ [[so much of this is repeated from previous section; choose one!]]

No one *simply* forgets the work of their hands; if the act of jabbing out one's eyes is not readily apparent, then it has been deliberately *obscured*. Is this next act of obscuring similarly forgotten? There is an infinite regress here: somewhere down the line, the Dreamers' dreaming must still be apparent to them, and this last unburried action is precisely what the *opportunity* triggers, what theatens to bring the truth of the whole endeavor surging back into awareness.

####The Actual Solution

It's important to note that, for complicated reasons (such as the absurd nature of sin) Socratic knowledge about one's sin state is not actually attained. Socrates never *convinces* Callicles through rational argument that he is in untruth, but he continues to engage him in dialogue *so as to forcibly draw his attention to it*---so as to make the active denial of truth, reason and the good (which is always active) *explicit*, so as to make it an issue and force it into consideration. Success here is not important; one does not need to convert the racist crowd. One engages in this way purely out of love (*eros*), as Socrates did. This is what it means to love your enemy: to [[Coates quote? might work]]

In either case [[failed or successful reasoning]], this act *shows* the other their error, their sin. If their intention was involved in it (if they sinned), then they will not be able to accept this; racism (like sin) must obscure its own activity in order to propperly (or impropperly) operate. If their intention was not there---if their belief was truly unexamined---then they may be more open to it. But *in either case*, the key function of reasoning is to offer an *opportunity* to move towards accountability by exposing the function (or lack thereof) of the self/intention/knowledge in one's beliefs and actions.

>"If I had not come and spoken unto them, they would not have sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin" (John 15:22).

To the extent that the Christian method (calling for repentance) is valid here, I believe it is, again, only so far as Kierkegaard understands it; that is, by repenting first oneself. To repent is to disclose one's sin publicly, to acknowledge the difficulty of waking up, of becoming vulnerable before the truth. And by disclosing oneself, we invite others to disclose themselves. For Kierkegaard, then, the Socratic method is fundamentally the best means of achieving the Christian solution, of bringing others to repent.
[[tho in this context that cannot apply to people of color, who do not necessarily have to repent of the same thing]]

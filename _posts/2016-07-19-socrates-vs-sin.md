There is an ancient and fundamental moral dispute in ethical philosophy, which can be roughly characterized thusly:

###Socrates:
No person knowingly does bad; evil is synonymous with ignorance. [Expand](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1672/1672-h/1672-h.htm)

[Augustine](http://www.ellopos.net/elpenor/greeks-us/augustine_plato-socrates.asp?pg=2)

[Aquinus](http://www.todayscatholicworld.com/willful-ignorance.htm)

###Christianity:
We are all in sin, and sin is [the existential state of] knowingly rejecting the good (often God or Christ).

This distinction might be brushed off as overly reductive for several reasons. First, neither Socrates nor the Christian tradition holds their position as an empirical claim. Rather, these are pragmatic ways of framing evil which encourage different ways of thinking about it and addressing it.

Second, we might protest that we are dealing here with two different conceptions of knowledge (or else of "wrong").

####Knowledge

- Socrates: Knowledge as a pure ideal of reason. Can do what one thinks or believes to be wrong, even if these beliefs turn out to be true or well-informed. Socrates is simply saying that, in doing what was actually wrong, one demonstrates that they didn’t fully grasp its wrongness and implications. If one truly knew that one’s actions were wrong, one would not do them. But few of us have ever had this kind of knowledge / certainty. This knowledge is not a simple matter of a mental declaration that “this is wrong;” it is a matter of being able to give reasons for why it is wrong, having fully understood its implications, and thus having a fully ordered, harmonious soul, such that all of one’s knowledge can be simultaneously affirmed without contradiction. If interrogated by Socrates, a person with this kind of knowledge would be able to give an account of themselves without stumbling into aporia. 

- Christianity: Knowledge as sinning “before god,” sin as a deliberate rejection of God’s love and assertion of oneself over and above God. Can be committed unknowingly at the time; original sin happened before we were born. One does not need to be able to articulate one’s reasons for acting in order to be caught in sin. One need not even need to have the the mental declaration “I do this before God” in order to sin---what is important is that one is actually sinning before God, but one might not be able to articulate this. As such, this is the kind of knowledge that has not yet been brought out by Socrates---it is buried or implicit---and so it could not be the same as “knowingly doing wrong” in the Socratic sense of knowledge.

- Kierkegaard: in Philosophical Fragments, we see that the limits of reason [dialogue/dialectic] do indeed extend to articulating one’s state of sin. In fact, the best that a mere human can do for another is to use reason to bring them into understanding of their sin (and Socrates is the best of all mere humans). It does seem that Kierkegaard believes that if one truly possesses this kind of Socratic knowledge, one will not commit further sins. However, it is not important for Kierkegaard that one’s prior sins need to have been committed deliberately and before God in order for sin to be performed knowingly. Kierkegaard evades this through what Anti-Climacus calls (in The Sickness Unto Death) the compounding of sin [quote]. Once one becomes aware (through Socrates or some other occasion) of one’s sin state---once one’s sins become fully real---then one is called to repent. The compounding of sin is just that every moment one fails to repent for one’s sins, one sins again---and this compounded sin is done in full Socratic knowledge. Knowledge of one’s sin, while a condition for repenting, is not the same as repenting. Repenting is an act of the will---a grasping of the paradox of sin---and Socrates cannot repent on behalf of another. This is what Kierkegaard is primarily worried about, and what he think Socrates can’t account for: the possibility of not acting when one knows one should, even if one’s knowledge is not enough to specify the exact course of action. The longer one waits, the harder it is to act, and the more one continues to do wrong despite knowing otherwise.

[is this relevant? Isn’t this sin a very particular kind of bad action?]

[relevance to responsibility; holding people accountable]

####Wrong

- Socrates: What Socrates means by “wrong” is very much conditioned by his (Plato’s) broader virtue ethic. It needs to be understood as part of his broader thesis that doing good is good for us and doing bad is bad for us. Not only does Socrates argue this is true, but he suggests that fully understanding this is a ground for acting ethically: one does good and avoids wrong _because_ one knows this is in one’s own best interest. This fact often begets an (overly reductive) footnote that Socrates _really_ means that no one knowingly does what is wrong _for them_. Besides the triviality of this claim, it implies far more ethical relativism than Plato would allow. What is wrong for us is _identical to_ what is wrong per-say. Yet, usually, those doing what they believe to be wrong have not fully grasped this fact.

- Christianity: Sin is before god: the “wrongness” in one’s sin is not characterized by what is strictly bad for oneself but as a matter of one’s relationship to the absolute. Although it may or may not be articulable as an abstract set of rules, still the measure of wrongness is external (or relational). Kierkegaard does imply (in the closely related Concluding Unscientific Postscript) that Kant generally got ethics right---his Christian wrongness is more deontological than virtuous---even if the abstract moral imperatives that govern the “ethical sphere” are not absolute [might be absolute, actually, even when God has us violate them. // Possible: people acting in faith are unable to give an account of their actions.

These can perhaps be roughly summed up as the difference between a disharmony within one’s own soul and a disharmony in the relation of one’s soul to God. This distinction is also often framed as that between good/bad and good/evil.

- Kierkegaard: Kierkegaard again takes care to bring these traditions into direct dialogue. He takes a roughly Augustinian approach, showing that a life of sin is in fact despair. It is true that the penitent or even the knight of faith is not necessarily a virtuous individual. And importantly, they do not do avoid wrong because it is bad for them. They avoid wrong because it is wrong. Yet it is still the case that doing wrong and existing in sin is a kind of despair [although knowledge of one’s sin (and thus repentance) is also a kind of despair]. __And, most importantly, Kierkegaard (in Sickness Unto Death [very complicated, do research]) argues that, because our soul is constituted as a relationship to the divine---in fact our relationship to God is what we are, since God is eternity/being---that there is no actual difference between a disharmony of our soul and a disharmony in our soul’s relation to God.__

[leave all of this off for the comments]

Kierkegaard brings these into direct dialogue, lands himself on a pretty orthodox interpretation of sin, but interprets it into a responsive/spontaneous ethic, which I find interesting.

However, even when we fail to properly attribute it [to Socrates and the Christian tradition], this dynamic pervades all of our attempts to address injustice. Do we simply rehabilitate the wrongdoer or---failing that---educate others so that this…

------------

####Objection:
why can’t we just do both? these are theoretically opposed, but practically? isn’t that exactly the approach of BLM to demand both accountability and structural change?

####Response:
we can do both. but the difference is still important for how we _understand_ (and thereby _explain_ and _give an account of_) our actions, whether in the area of accountability or structural change. are the failures of police accountability due to the beliefs and preconceptions held by the police officers? or are they due to the structurally-defined _interests_ of the officers (and their institution.) does the resistance we see to police reform arise because officers genuinely believe that the current structure is ideal---that reform would put them in danger or hamper their ability to do their job? or does it arise because the current structure _benifits_ those involved in ways that the reformed structure would not?

this has real effects on the solutions we propose: education and training programs for police, vs. increased presence of local community members and people of color in the force...ousting white supremacists...

####Problems here
1. Genuine belief vs _actual_ (but not necessarily intentional) interest is not necessarily the distinction I'm going for. I think the latter is uncontroversially an operator in this stuff, and its important for the middle line I'm trying to toe. The SvS distinction is more genuine false belief vs malicious intent...one can benefit from a system (and act to preserve that benefit) without conscious intent.
2. Does this further difference in understanding actually lead to a difference in course of action though? Can one not advocate both police training _and_ increased representation in the force?

Tentative solution: it's not about the policies or points made, it's about the reasons used and the ways they are articulated and championed.

------------

I raise this distinction (and forgive me for setting it out in such diametrical opposition, but it serves my purposes) because I believe this core disagreement over how we explain (and thereafter address) wrong action is especially relevant to the ethics of oppression. How should we understand oppressive action? Who can be held accountable for systemic injustices? What approach is best for assuring accountability and addressing this action? These questions are relevant to the framework we use…[like those above.]

Ta-Nehisi Coates's _Between the World and Me_ takes up this dichotomy in the context of American racism. ...he recalls leaving a movie theater in the Upper West Side, his son running ahead into a restless crowd, and a white woman stepping forward and pushing him out of her way. "Come on!" Coates devotes a significant part of the section to analyzing his reaction to this (stepping in to protect his son, calling her out) and the racial dynamics of the situation.

At first, he takes what I would call the popular approach to the situation---roughly in line with Socratic ethical premises---and specifically to the issue of how to explain and contextualize [eh] this woman's action. He shows how emphasizing _intention_ as a defining element of "true racism" turns it into an impossible ideal (an individual knowingly denying a person’s personhood, analogous to sin). 

>But my experience in this world has been that the people who believe themselves to be white are obsessed with the politics of personal exoneration. And the word racist, to them, conjures, if not a tobacco-spitting oaf, then something just as fantastic—an orc, troll, or gorgon. "I'm not a racist," an entertainer once insisted after being filmed repeatedly yelling at a heckler: "He's a nigger! He's a nigger!" (97).

This impossible ideal then obscures the operations of systematic racism, by making individual injustices suspect to an extraordinary... As long as there [[find a snippet]] "no racial epithets were uttered"---as long as the white woman didn't proclaim her racism loudly to the world [[after quote]], then ...in fact, even raising the racial dimension of a situation like that becomes insulting; insinuating a deliberate dimension that was not there.

The "tobacco-spitting oaf" becomes the sinner, and sin becomes something we cannot see or acknowledge in ourselves because it is so foreign and extreme. The very defining feature of sin---its deliberate, intentional feature---is what makes sin so unbelievable...and thereby makes repenting impossible.

Coates points out that this is not just a theoretical consideration. His all-too-brief historical examples of these "politics of personal exoneration" span the entire twentieth century [[or more? lynching examples]], from Michael Richards to Strom Thurmond to the segregationist residents of Levittown, PA. To each of them---no matter how explicit their white supremacy---











Followed by Nixon to Strom Thurmond: “Strom is no racist.” Inability to find blame in lynch mobs: “persons unknown.”

>In 1957, the white residents of Levittown, Pennsylvania, argued for their right to keep their town segregated. "As moral, religious and law-abiding citizens," the group wrote, "we feel that we are unprejudiced and undiscriminating in our wish to keep our community a closed community." This was the attempt to commit a shameful act while escaping all sanction, and I raise it to show you that there was no golden era when evildoers did their business and loudly proclaimed it as such (p.98).

Yet I am convinced that there is some kind of knowledge involved here. Ignoring the role of intention in systematic racism seems just as problematic to ignore as insisting on it; to ignore the role of intention is, in a way, to accept the account of racism as a kind of natural phenomenon, where nobody can be held any more accountable than another, where lynchings are carried out by "persons unknown"---the account that turns an _outrageous_ act into a _tragic_ one.

>I knew for instance, that she would not have pushed a black child out on my part of Flatbush, because she would be afraid there and would sense, if not know, that there would be a penalty for such an action (94).

This is a very unrefined kind of knowledge we're describing here, this sensing-if-not-knowing. It would not pass muster for Socratic knowledge: it is generally unexpressed, and likely unconscious. Yet it is still there. The Socratic name for it would be _unrecollected_ knowledge; we have forgotten that we know it. But a little bit of Socratic interrogation would bring one to affirm it, provided the will to face the basic truth that "no, I would not have pushed your kid out on your part of Flatbush."

This kind of knowledge strikes me as awfully close to the Christian model of sin. It does not require intention, consciousness, or even any unconscious mental content. It is simply demonstrated by a fact of character/action. This knowledge just _is_ the way we (would) conduct ourselves...since our conduct reveals implicit knowledge about our values...it reveals an understanding of what is beneficial/permissable and in what contexts.

Just as our sin _is_ the fact that, were we alive in Christs time, we would eagerly nail him to the cross. It is a fact of the refusal to love...even if the _opportunity_ to express that fact---whether in Christ or Socrates---has not arisen yet. The opportunity is incidental to sin. Living in the Upper West Side, a white person may commit less actual microaggressions for sheer lack of opportunity. Their sins are no less for this.

------------

####Comment:
Evan Thompson, or somebody, names these kinds of knowledge or thought: conceptual normativity and something...one being discursive, but both being conceptual, both involving an understanding of rules, difference, privilege, etc. The same knowledge involved in playing football as in pulling rank, playing in the field of systemic racism.

-----------------

Perhaps this is really all the knowledge that is required for sin, and we should follow Kierkegaard in decrying Christendom for preaching our innocence.

Coates implies a kind of knowledge, even while denying the helpfulness of ‘racism’ as understood by the people that think they are white:

>The mettle that it takes to look away from the horror of our prison system, from police forces transformed into armies, from the long war against the black body, is not forged overnight. This is the practiced habit of jabbing out one’s eyes and forgetting the work of one’s hands (p.98).

This is not the simple ignorance of those watching the shadows in Plato's cave. It is not an arduous climb to see the surface. There is television in this cave, and we are neither chained to the wall nor any single channel. One needs to *will* to remain ignorant, and the act of jabbing out one's eyes betrays an awareness of what they might otherwise see.

“forgetting the work of one’s hands,” literally obscuring one’s agency in the whole thing (Heideggerian conscience), forgetting that we killed Christ

Kierkegaard’s solution is repentance, but nothing so analogous in social justice. We can repent our country, our history—we can (and should) acknowledge our privilege—but, as with sin, all the penance in the world can’t take away the basic fact of it. But for Kierkegaard, the final salvation is a matter of faith. It’s up to Christ. Coates, I imagine, would have none of this.

Real interesting part later:

>By the time I visited those battlefields, I knew that they had been retrofitted as the staging ground for a great deception, and this was my only security, because they could no longer insult me by lying to me. I knew—and the most important thing I knew was that, somewhere deep with them [sic], they knew too. I like to think that knowing might have kept me from endangering you, that hav-//ing understood and acknowledged the anger, I could control it. I like to think that it could have allowed me to speak the needed words to the woman and then walk away. I like to think this, but I can’t promise it. The struggle is really all I have for you because it is the only portion of this world under your control (106-7).

Does this knowledge properly qualify as Socratic? It's tempting to say no, simply because this knowledge is so often unarticulated. But that's not to say that it is truly _inarticulable_. This knowledge, indeed, accurately represents the structure of systematic racism---it _needs_ to in order for white people to be able to take advantage of their place in it so well and so frequently.

All of this seems to be known, by Socratic lights. The only thing that seems to be _not_ known Socratically is that this whole structure of white supremacy is bad _for whites_; i.e. for those ... It seems apparent enough that---if this were understood---white people would *not* take advantage of their priviledge, because doing so actually puts them at a disadvantage... This depends upon a theoretical argument that would crib the form of Plato's argument in the *Republic* that it is better to suffer under tyranny than to be a tyrant; that it is better to be oppressed than to be an oppressor. Coates, interestingly enough, expresses this sentiment to his son....

The Socratic line of thinking, then, would offer this solution to the problem: to teach white America that white supremacy is *not* in their own self interest---that it benefits nobody more than a system of egalitarianism, that it functions as an elitist tool to divide the lower class against itself. The primary remedies in this framework are education and economic equality--systematic reforms.

[[I fear that in the Socratic approach there lurks and infinite regress, as it is the cultural elite that both controls this knowledge (can formulate it into argument and transmit it) *and* (as often happens) provides the misinformation. In order to teach the lower [[labor]] class that white supremacy is not in their best interest, the elite must first understand that it is not in *their* best interest to divide the lower class against themselves. Who will teach them this? [[or not, just where do we start to educate? (interesting alt version of meno's paradox)]] Unfortunately Socrates is long dead, and Meno's paradox survives him. The knowledge required here is truly Socratic in the sense of nearly unattainable, semi-divine understanding that regresses towards fundamental principles.]]

---------

The Christian framework accepts that dialogue is necessary to atone as a nation, but it is not sufficient---it is not itself atonement. This is approach is necessary for understanding our sin---America's sin---but following this understanding, the Christian calls on white America to *repent*. The Christian believes that there are some (and now we are probably looking at the cultural elites) who fully understand both the nature of systematic racism *and* the way it disadvantages whites and deprives oppressors of virtue/humanity. And yet even this understanding does not prevent them from taking advantage of their priviledge---from permitting and reinforcing racism.

[[The christian framework calls on white America to repent.]]
......

I want to bring Kierkegaard back in here because his work in synthesizing the two traditions has interesting implications for our purposes. Dialogue is insufficient, yet it also *must* precede repentance and accountability; it is a necessary condition for acknowledging one's priviledge and taking responsibility for one's actions.

Police officers cannot be held accountable until they understand that they are in the wrong. Indictments are important for *instilling* this understanding, but an indictment here and there does not provide that. A convicted officer recieves punishment, but this is not the same as being held accountable. Until we get to that point, punishment is just another ordeal; a threat on blue lives. It is something suffered for the cause, and I fear that such suffering actually increases in-group loyalty: it mobilizes the police; it arms and armors them.

We need not be worried that this will be an exact mirror image of the BLM movement and the way each tradgedy reinforces it. The police cannot organize in the same way; their situation is not the same; their history is not the same. And their inability to organize betrays that---in some remote way---they understand this. This is where true knowledge can arise.

Police departments cannot be held accountable until they are brought to an understanding of their role in systematic racism. America cannot be held accountable until it understands its history. Demands for accountability might be good teaching tools, but until the understanding is there, that is all they are.

This kind of knowledge is very much 



[Don’t necessarily need an answer for this piece, tho worth exploring the slippery nature of this “knowledge” for those that hold it, the way that it expresses itself as bullshit, that it is so tied up in power; it is not denied out of true belief, but out of a (tacitly understood, vaguely grasped) sense that one will benefit from denying it. The politics of personal exoneration are not concerned with uncovering the true structure of our society; this structure simply doesn’t play a part in the claims (and even genuine fears!) of the ‘attack on white America.’]

There is an ancient and fundamental moral dispute in ethical philosophy, which can be roughly characterized thusly:

###Socrates:
No person knowingly does bad; evil is synonymous with ignorance. [Expand](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1672/1672-h/1672-h.htm)

[Augustine](http://www.ellopos.net/elpenor/greeks-us/augustine_plato-socrates.asp?pg=2)

[Aquinus](http://www.todayscatholicworld.com/willful-ignorance.htm)

###Christianity:
We are all in sin, and sin is [the existential state of] knowingly rejecting the good (often God or Christ).

This distinction might be brushed off as overly reductive for several reasons. First, neither Socrates nor the Christian tradition holds their position as an empirical claim. Rather, these are pragmatic ways of framing evil which encourage different ways of thinking about it and addressing it.

Second, we might protest that we are dealing here with two different conceptions of knowledge (or else of "wrong").

####Knowledge

- Socrates: Knowledge as a pure ideal of reason. Can do what one thinks or believes to be wrong, even if these beliefs turn out to be true or well-informed. Socrates is simply saying that, in doing what was actually wrong, one demonstrates that they didn’t fully grasp its wrongness and implications. If one truly knew that one’s actions were wrong, one would not do them. But few of us have ever had this kind of knowledge / certainty. This knowledge is not a simple matter of a mental declaration that “this is wrong;” it is a matter of being able to give reasons for why it is wrong, having fully understood its implications, and thus having a fully ordered, harmonious soul, such that all of one’s knowledge can be simultaneously affirmed without contradiction. If interrogated by Socrates, a person with this kind of knowledge would be able to give an account of themselves without stumbling into aporia. 

- Christianity: Knowledge as sinning “before god,” sin as a deliberate rejection of God’s love and assertion of oneself over and above God. Can be committed unknowingly at the time; original sin happened before we were born. One does not need to be able to articulate one’s reasons for acting in order to be caught in sin. One need not even need to have the the mental declaration “I do this before God” in order to sin--what is important is that one is actually sinning before God, but one might not be able to articulate this. As such, this is the kind of knowledge that has not yet been brought out by Socrates--it is buried or implicit--and so it could not be the same as “knowingly doing wrong” in the Socratic sense.

- Kierkegaard: in Philosophical Fragments, we see that the limits of reason [dialogue/dialectic] do indeed extend to articulating one’s state of sin. In fact, the best that a mere human can do for another is to use reason to bring them into understanding of their sin (and Socrates is the best of all mere humans). It does seem that Kierkegaard believes that if one truly possesses this kind of Socratic knowledge, one will not commit further sins. However, it is not important for Kierkegaard that one’s prior sins need to have been committed deliberately and before God in order for sin to be performed knowingly. Kierkegaard evades this through what Anti-Climacus calls (in The Sickness Unto Death) the compounding of sin [quote]. Once one becomes aware (through Socrates or some other occasion) of one’s sin state--once one’s sins become fully real--then one is called to repent. The compounding of sin is just that every moment one fails to repent for one’s sins, one sins again--and this compounded sin is done in full Socratic knowledge. Knowledge of one’s sin, while a condition for repenting, is not the same as repenting. Repenting is an act of the will--a grasping of the paradox of sin--and Socrates cannot repent on behalf of another. This is what Kierkegaard is primarily worried about, and what he think Socrates can’t account for: the possibility of not acting when one knows one should, even if one’s knowledge is not enough to specify the exact course of action. The longer one waits, the harder it is to act, and the more one continues to do wrong despite knowing otherwise.

[is this relevant? Isn’t this sin a very particular kind of bad action?]

[relevance to responsibility; holding people accountable]

####Wrong

- Socrates: What Socrates means by “wrong” is very much conditioned by his (Plato’s) broader virtue ethic. It needs to be understood as part of his broader thesis that doing good is good for us and doing bad is bad for us. Not only does Socrates argue this is true, but he suggests that fully understanding this is a ground for acting ethically: one does good and avoids wrong because one knows this is in one’s own best interest. This fact often begets an (overly reductive) footnote that Socrates really means that no one knowingly does what is wrong for them. Besides the triviality of this claim, it implies far more subjectivity than Plato would allow. What is wrong for us is still what is wrong per-say. Yet usually when one does what one seems to know is wrong, it is because one hasn’t fully grasped this fact.

- Christianity: Sin is before god: the “wrongness” in one’s sin is not characterized by what is strictly bad for oneself but as a matter of one’s relationship to the absolute. Although it may or may not be articulable as an abstract set of rules, still the measure of wrongness is external (or relational). Kierkegaard does imply (in the closely related Concluding Unscientific Postscript) that Kant generally got it right--this Christian wrongness is more deontological than virtuous--even if the abstract moral imperatives that govern the “ethical sphere” are not absolute [might be absolute, actually, even when God has us violate them. // Possible: people acting in faith are unable to give an account of their actions.

These can perhaps be roughly summed up as the difference between a disharmony within one’s own soul and a disharmony in the relation of one’s soul to God. This distinction is also often framed as that between good/bad and good/evil.

- Kierkegaard: Kierkegaard again takes care to bring these traditions into direct dialogue. He takes a roughly Augustinian approach, showing that a life of sin is in fact despair. It is true that the penitent or even the knight of faith is not necessarily a virtuous individual. And importantly, they do not do avoid wrong because it is bad for them. They avoid wrong because it is wrong. Yet it is still the case that doing wrong and existing in sin is a kind of despair [although knowledge of one’s sin (and thus repentance) is also a kind of despair]. And importantly, Kierkegaard (in Sickness Unto Death [very complicated, do research]) argues that, because our soul is constituted as a relationship to the divine--in fact our relationship to God is what we are, since God is eternity/being--that there is no actual difference between a disharmony of our soul and a disharmony in our soul’s relation to God.

[leave all of this off for the comments]

Kierkegaard brings these into direct dialogue, lands himself on a pretty orthodox interpretation of sin, but interprets it into a responsive/spontaneous ethic, which I find interesting.

However, even when we fail to properly attribute it [to Socrates and the Christian tradition], this dynamic pervades all our attempts to address injustice. Do we simply rehabilitate the wrongdoer or--failing that--educate others so that this…

[why can’t we just do both? these are theoretically opposed, but practically? isn’t that exactly the approach of BLM to demand both accountability and structural change?]

I raise this distinction (and forgive me for setting it out in such diametrical opposition, but it serves my purposes) because I believe this core disagreement over how we explain (and thereafter address) wrong action is especially relevant to the ethics of oppression. How should we understand oppressive action? Who can be held accountable for systemic injustices? What approach is best for assuring accountability and addressing this action? These questions are relevant to the framework we use…[like those above.]

In Between the World and Me, Ta-Nehisi Coates explicitly raises this issue in the context of American racism in the context of [a certain story]...

At first, he takes what I believe is the popular approach to this...

the way that an impossible ideal of racism (an individual knowingly denying a person’s personhood, analogous to sin) obscures the operations of systematic racism.
 
“There was my sense that this woman was pulling rank. I knew for instance, that she would not have pushed a black child out on my part of Flatbush, because she would be afraid there and would sense, if not know, that there would be a penalty for such an action” (94).

“But my experience in this world has been that the people who believe themselves to be white are obsessed with the politics of personal exoneration. And the word racist, to them, conjures, if not a tobacco-spitting oaf, then something just as fantastic—an orc, troll, or gorgon. ‘I’m not a racist,’ an entertainer once insisted after being filmed repeatedly yelling at a heckler: ‘He’s a nigger! He’s a nigger!’” (97).

Followed by Nixon to Strom Thurmond: “Strom is no racist.” Inability to find blame in lynch mobs: “persons unknown.”

“In 1957, the white residents of Levittown, Pennsylvania, argued for their right to keep their town segregated. ‘As moral, religious and law-abiding citizens,’ the group wrote, ‘we feel that we are unprejudiced and undiscriminating in our wish to keep our community a closed community.’ This was the attempt to commit a shameful act while escaping all sanction, and I raise it to show you that there was no golden era when evildoers did their business and loudly proclaimed it as such” (p.98).

The way oppression influences this discussion is interesting to me. [Worth revisiting the feminist Kantian from Elise’s class.] I generally want to fall somewhere in the middle between Socrates and Sin. I am convinced that there is some kind of knowledge involved here: the knowledge that Coates describes as the white woman ‘pulling rank’ in the Upper West Side, knowing she would never do that on Flatbush. A very unrefined kind of knowledge, this sensing-if-not-knowing, generally unexpressed, arguably unconscious, but one which a little bit of Socratic questioning could bring one to recollect. [Evan Thompson, or somebody, names these kinds of knowledge or thought: conceptual normativity and something...one being discursive, but both being conceptual, both involving an understanding of rules, difference, privilege, etc. The same knowledge involved in playing football as in pulling rank, playing in the field of systemic racism.]

Perhaps this is really all the knowledge that is required for sin, and we should follow Kierkegaard in decrying Christendom for preaching our innocence.

Coates implies a kind of knowledge, even while denying the helpfulness of ‘racism’ as understood by the people that think they are white: “The mettle that it takes to look away from the horror of our prison system, from police forces transformed into armies, from the long war against the black body, is not forged overnight. This is the practiced habit of jabbing out one’s eyes and forgetting the work of one’s hands. To acknowledge these horrors means turning away from the brightly rendered version of your country as it has always declared itself and turning toward something murkier and unknown. It is still too difficult for most // Americans to do this” (p.98-99).

“forgetting the work of one’s hands,” literally obscuring one’s agency in the whole thing (Heideggerian conscience), forgetting that we killed Christ

Kierkegaard’s solution is repentance, but nothing so analogous in social justice. We can repent our country, our history—we can (and should) acknowledge our privilege—but, as with sin, all the penance in the world can’t take away the basic fact of it. But for Kierkegaard, the final salvation is a matter of faith. It’s up to Christ. Coates, I imagine, would have none of this.

Real interesting part later: “By the time I visited those battlefields, I knew that they had been retrofitted as the staging ground for a great deception, and this was my only security, because they could no longer insult me by lying to me. I knew—and the most important thing I knew was that, somewhere deep with them [sic], they knew too. I like to think that knowing might have kept me from endangering you, that hav-//ing understood and acknowledged the anger, I could control it. I like to think that it could have allowed me to speak the needed words to the woman and then walk away. I like to think this, but I can’t promise it. The struggle is really all I have for you because it is the only portion of this world under your control” (106-7).

[Don’t necessarily need an answer for this piece, tho worth exploring the slippery nature of this “knowledge” for those that hold it, the way that it expresses itself as bullshit, that it is so tied up in power; it is not denied out of true belief, but out of a (tacitly understood, vaguely grasped) sense that one will benefit from denying it. The politics of personal exoneration are not concerned with uncovering the true structure of our society; this structure simply doesn’t play a part in the claims (and even genuine fears!) of the ‘attack on white America.’]

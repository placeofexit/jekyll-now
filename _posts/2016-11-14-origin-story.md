>In the beginning, the river lay still as glass, and Heaven saw itself reflected in the faceless riverbed. Yet even as it faced itself, Heaven did not know itself, but mistook the river as its own reflection. Heaven longed to go somewhere, but day after day, the river refused to move.

We have, at the outset, a clear ontological priority given to stillness or receptivity (*jing*) as opposed to movement or activity (*dong*). Interestingly, this stillness is found first in the river and then reflected onto Heaven, although it later comes to be identified with Heaven as a principle.[^1] Metaphorically, however, the stillness of the river turns out to be *dependent* on the stillness of Heaven, so we can think of Heaven as a fundamentally still entity.

Heaven then seems to be a source of 
One can note the obvious parallels here with Plotinus's metaphysics, which located a single cosmic force ("The One"), which was the source of all things, yet removed from the actual activity of creation by several degrees. Here, of course, the fundamental, originary principle seems to be stillness rather than oneness.

It is interesting that Heaven seems to coexist with the river...
Some have argued (rather forcefully) that such a distinction, prior to any activity from Heaven, indicates an early, indigenous ontological dualism, which must have been forgotton by later Chinese thinkers (along with the river and its people).
...river is the *material* for creation (again, somewhat like what we find in Neo-Platonism). Yet if Heaven is fundamentally still, the river is not opposed to it, but shares in its stillness. It's unclear how the river qualifies as a dualism, besides simply being another entity.

It is worth thinking, also, about what rivers represent. Metaphorically, they are objects of flux, themselves changing but also sources of change, through floods...
...also origin of all human civilization, giving clean water and fertalizing crops.
They are conceptually intimate with time.

We also are presented with the issue that originally, Heaven does not know itself. Unlike Plotinus's "One" and the Shankara's "Purusha," this original force/deity is not self-aware; indeed, it fundamentally misunderstands itself. This anticipates the later use of *jing* and *dong* in the psychological ... of the *Record of Ritual*.[^1] We also find this notion in Hegel... immediacy is fundamentally empty and still (spaceless and timeless) and has no content; Hegel's *Geist*, Spirit, deriving from immediacy, lacks self-consciousness, which is only developed through its dialectical activity.

[^1]: Possibly, stillness and receptivity are simply synonymous with a "beginning" as such, since it implies readiness and the possibility of change. This would become especially apparent in the later *yin/yang* system, which emphasized the.... The importance of the receptivity/activity dyad preceded it, yet these were not formalized as aspects of the *yin/yang* relationship until the *Yijing*. 

[^1]: Specifically, I have in mind this passage: "Human beings are in a state of stillness when born, this is their Heavenly nature…. They are touched off by [external] things and [only then] move; these are the desires belonging to their nature…. But after things arrive, the [faculty of] knowledge…apprehends them—only then do likes and dislikes take shape therein. If likes and dislikes have no regulation within, and the [faculty of ] knowledge is enticed from without, [human beings] can not reflect upon themselves, and the Heavenly coherence {*tianli*}…is destroyed."

>Forgetting itself in the waters, Heaven let out a sigh, and and its sigh hugged the river and took posession of its waters. It called itself Spirit...

We have selected the term "Spirit" as an appropriate translation for original name of this deity: Qi (pronounced "chee").[^1] *Qi* shares its etymology with the Latin *spiritus*, appearing originally as a term for *breath*. Unlike the Latin, but like the Greek *pneuma* (for which *spiritus* became an early accepted translation) *qi* (breath) soon became identified as a fundamental principal of activity and vitality, the kinetic cause of living things. Since this precedes that usage, however, we can think of *Qi*, the deity, as literally the "breath of Heaven," that is, the wind. This provides a sort of intuition pump for the apparent priority of stillness and the possibility of its opposite (activity, or *dong*) emerging spontaneously. We know that the wind comes from Heaven (which did not include heavenly bodies such as clouds, but specifically indicated that vast emptiness in which these bodies could manifest), yet Heaven does not sacrifice its own stillness in giving rise to it.

Note that, here, Spirit manifests as a result of Heaven's "forgetting" itself---that is, forgetting itself as a fundamental stillness. Later commentaries describe this forgetting as inevitable, since, as a pure stillness (*jing*), Heaven c

We also have two specific activities emphasized in relation to Spirit: those of *possessing* and *naming*. Their conflation later in the story has been the subject of much debate, so it is worth noting for now that they are initially identified as the first two actions Spirit performs---or as some have argued, a single action with two consequences.

[^1]: This is indeed the same character that would later be taken up by Confucius and Mencius as a formal philosophical term. Its usage here precedes such associations as we would find in them, and much later in the Neo-Confucian metaphysics, but we can see here an anticipation of its centrality the later Chinese worldview.

>and Spirit spoke to Heaven: "Heaven, you are beautiful, but you do not see it. Let me show you what you are."

>With that, the rivertop broke out into capillary waves. Dancing wavelets fashioned Heaven’s light into a web of quivering milk strands, and cast this upwards from their gleaming peaks and ridges. Heaven recognized something of itself itself in this light, and it delighted in Spirit's fanciful rendering. In a fit of laughter, Heaven let fly another breath.

Spirit presents Heaven with an opportunity to know itself. Again, the resonances with Hegel are significant, yet worth noticing differences: here, Spirit is not coming to know *itself*; the emphasis is on Heaven's (immediacy's) knowing itself in it's own stillness. Whether this is possible is immediately problematized: it is presented as a kind of flattery, a fanciful rendering that fails to bring Heaven to authentic self-knowledge.

Again, the lack of self-knowledge is presented as the cause of activity, that which fuels Spirit and thus leads further from self-knowledge, into further activity.

>This breath skirted low across the water, lifting up the wavelets and rippling along their trowes. From the ripples that now lined these watery valleys, Spirit fashioned vegetable life. The vegetation basked in Heaven, and Heaven delighted in this.

>So Heaven sent another breath along the river. Now the valleys of the wavelets twisted towards the riverbed. Out of these burrowing torrents, Spirit fashioned animal life, and the animals communed with Heaven, and Heaven delighted in this.

>So Heaven heaved one last breath down the river, and the waters churned higher and deeper, until these watery canyons dredged up the muck of the riverbed. Out of this muck, Spirit fashioned people, and the people spoke of Heaven, and Heaven delighted in this.

Here we have a three-fold story of creation, each level progressing *deeper* into the river until we finally get to the riverbed.
[[what does this mean?]]

3-fold creation matches Xunzi, but...

It is worth noting: basking, communing, speaking,
Could also be mapped onto Xunzi

Dr. ___ has suggested that these are fundamentally different categories
- microorganisms
- organisms with mitochondria
- language users

Couldn't possibly have known about these biological "leaps." Yet...

...already shows a queer foresight in identifying the category of "people" by the ability to use language, a definition widely accepted by biologists and philosophers of language alike.

>Now Spirit had grown strong through Heaven, and Spirit did not want Heaven to remember its original stillness. So Spirit gave each person a name, and for each person this name was “Mine,” and each person labored for Spirit under the weight of that name. Through their labor, Spirit tamed the animals and cultivated the vegetation, and through their labor, Spirit made the river dance in the light of Heaven.

>Whenever one of Spirit’s waves passed under the people, it raised them up to its brilliant crest. Astonished by the light, the people praised Heaven, and Heaven delighted in their praise. Yet as the wave passed on, it lowered the people into its shadowy trough. Here the people cursed Heaven, but they cursd in vain, for Heaven could not hear them.

>The deeper Spirit dove, the more the people toiled in their troughs, isolated in darkness, not knowing Heaven. And through Spirit’s roiling, the river's waves grew so steep that when the people found themselves cast aloft on some shining crest, they had no time to look for the source of the light. They could see over the edge into the darkness that would soon reclaim them, so they clutched vainly at the gold water and called it "Mine," for that was all they knew.

>Seeing that the people claimed its light as their own, Heaven could no longer rejoice in the gleam of the river. With its last breath, it called on Spirit to leave, but Spirit used this breath to fashion itself a face out of the deep, and with all the fury in this face, Spirit scowled skyward.

>In a moment of shock, Heaven remembered itself in its own stillness, and abiding in this memory, Heaven stilled its breathing. The waters calmed, and the face of Spirit yawned and passed under the waves. Yet Spirit was not cast entirely from the river, for the people remained, and by their bitter breathing, Spirit endured. Spirit would never again tempt Heaven to stir up the waters, but the people of the river had already tasted Heaven's light. They spoke of it even in darkness, and still longed to catch it once more along the water's edge. So the people toiled to keep the waves surging ever higher, all in the name of "Mine."

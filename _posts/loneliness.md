### Pathology

When loneliness arises, one should observe its cause: not a lack of company, but a sense of deficiency in one’s self, an unwillingness to be with oneself. Such situations reveal the way in which one’s self has founded itself on externals; this is why the felt deficiency typically compels one in pursuit of externals---namely, the company that seems to be absent. If the self had not founded itself externally, then this absence would not even be noticed.

### Diagnosis

The popular diagnosis is that one’s self has become "insecure," and the popular prescription is to *secure* oneself through the practice of self-esteem. This esteem is *self*-esteem in the sense that it is both *for* the self and *from* the self. Since external esteem lacks this dynamic, the popular practice of self-esteem attempts to shift the self onto what is *internal*, and views this as the root of security, confidence, and love.

This common opinion fundamentally misdiagnoses the situation by assuming that the self founded on externals---because of its instability---is a kind of false self. Since truth is the opposite of falsity, the true self must be founded on the opposite of these externals--and this is where we get the idea of the internal. Without this roundabout (yet commonly accepted) form of reasoning, the injunction to "look within" would naturally enough be met by confusion: "within what?"

What people often find upon such reflection are a collection of moods, beliefs, and personal projects. One percieves a certain kind of privileged access to these things---noting that one often engages with these things in isolation---and this is what allows them to satisfy the unclarified condition of "interiority."

Yet closer inspection reveals that these moods, beliefs, and projects are no more secure and stable than those things previously considered "external." The failure of a project, the refutation of a belief, or a simple change in mood can bring the whole thing toppling down. Privileged access does not imply mastery. What one had called the internal turns out to behave largely in accordance with externalities; what one believed to be an insulated enclosure turns out to be a mere canvas drape. This is no place to found a secure self.

In fact, to be a self is to be *fundamentally* insecure. One’s self is necessarily founded on externals (although now we may begin to feel silly calling them externals, without knowing what they are external to), and as such it is constantly engaged in its own deficiency. It is a wonder that people generally do not notice this---or perhaps it is no wonder, as most deficiencies are readily compensated for by a subtle shifting and rearranging of the self, and the appearance of new deficiencies in the process can be similarly addressed. It takes a truly staggering loss to render the self deficient in a way that prompts the inward-turning reflection, and it takes a keen eye to see the fallibility of the first interior---to see it as a simple foyer and mudroom---and so to move deeper.

True inward reflection reflects nothing. The move inwards was, after all, a mistake. Yet in reflecting nothing, one nullifies that mistake; this inner nothingness collapses the entire distinction, as the externals *have nothing* to be external to. As the wall between inner and outer crumbles, so does the the isolating factor  This is the proper cure, though admittedly it cures a sickness one did not realize one had. Loneliness turns out to be a mere symptom of this sickness, this hypertension of the self. As a result, we do *not* have a cure for the deficiency of self that initially manifested as the cause of loneliness. This deficiency was mischaracterized as the result of an external lack, when it was simply *a lack*: a lack that is a nothingness (a self).

This lack is the cure, not the sickness. Embracing this lack is the proper prescription for loneliness.

### Treatment

Depending on the patient and their particular disposition, one or several of the following practices for embracing one's lack may be prescribed:

 - As loneliness arises, one should observe that the presense or absence of company is not in one's hands, and that one is often compelled to spend time alone.
 - If, when alone, you find yourself deficient, reflect on the foundations of your self by asking: "what do I identify with?" or "what do I call 'mine?'" Ask yourself whether there is anything more stable and secure to found your self upon. Run through the possible foundations, and inquire of each "where are the cracks?" or "what are the conditions of collapse?" drawing the conclusion that each foundation would buckle under the infinite weight of your self. Repeat this inquiry to the point of exhaustion.
 - Try asking yourself, rather directly, "what am I?" or "what am I meant to be?" Without expecting an answer to come to you, consider that this question is of utmost importance, that nothing should concern you more.
 - Spend time alone every day, preferably somewhere outside with good light and circulation.
 - If in a public place, observe those passing nearby, and ask "how have they founded themselves? what do they consider their own?" Be as particular and accurate as possible, and consider whether these foundations are more secure than your own. Ask whether any of these people have managed to secure themselves against loneliness (concluding in each case that they have not). Reflect on the strange kinship created by this pervasive loneliness---that no self is secure against a partial or complete theft---that we share our isolation.
 - Discuss your loneliness with a friend.
 - If you are particularly disposed to loneliness, consider the circumstances in which loneliness has arisen in the past. Observe that its arising is not related to actual isolation; that loneliness arises just as well in the day as at night, in company as in solitude, among friends as well as enemies.
 - If you begins to suspect that it might be best, considering all these insufficient foundations, to give up on the project of securing yourself---that is, to found it on nothing at all---then observe that this the self is *precisely* this nothingness, and that a self founded upon nothing (itself) is in the same relation as that inherent in the popular notion of "self-esteem." The self founded on nothing supports itself for and from itself.

[Change “one” to “the patient”]

When loneliness arises, one should observe its cause: not a lack of company, but a sense of deficiency in one’s self, an unwillingness to be with oneself. Such situations reveal the way in which one’s self has founded itself on externals; this is why the felt deficiency compels one in pursuit of externals. If the self had not founded itself externally, then their absence would be a trivial matter---would not even be noticed.

The popular diagnosis is that one’s self has become “insecure,” and the popular prescription is to establish a “security” through the practice of “self-esteem.” [self-love] One is told to find self-confidence by restructuring oneself on what is *internal*, what one can sustainably provide.

This common opinion fundamentally misdiagnoses the situation by assuming that the self founded on externals---because of its instability---is a kind of false self. Since truth is the opposite of falsity, the true self must be founded on the opposite of these externals--and this is where we get the idea of the internal. Without this roundabout (yet commonly accepted) form of reasoning, the injunction to "look within" would naturally enough be met by confusion: "within what?"

The fact of the matter is that to be a self is to be *fundamentally* insecure. One’s self is necessarily founded on externals (although now we may begin to feel silly calling them externals, without knowing what they are external to), and as such it is constantly engaged in its own deficiency.

It is a wonder that people generally do not notice this---or perhaps it is no wonder, as most deficiencies are readily compensated for by a subtle shifting and rearranging of the self. It takes a truly staggering loss to render the self deficient in the way we consider *lonely*, and so to make that deficiency visible as such, and so to prompt an inward-turning reflection.

What people often find upon such reflection are a collection of moods, beliefs, and personal or shared projects---all in all, a set of things which one has privileged access to, which one commonly enjoys without the company of others (and this is what allows them to satisfy the unclarified condition of “interiority”).

Yet closer inspection reveals that these moods, beliefs, and projects are no more secure and stable than those things previously considered “external.” The failure of a project, the refutation of a belief, or a simple change in mood can bring the whole thing toppling down. [stoics: is this change in our control?] This is no place to found the secure self that one covets.

True inward reflection reflects nothing. The move inwards was, after all, a mistake. Yet in reflecting nothing, one nullifies that mistake; this inner nothingness collapses the entire distinction, and abolishes the loner that *could be lonely*---that could stand fundamentally separate from the objects of desire [?], as an internal into which nothing can enter. This is the proper cure, though admittedly a cure to a sickness one did not realize one had.

This is *not*, however, a cure for the deficiency of the self that we initially found at the root [maybe wrong word] of loneliness. This deficiency was mischaracterized as the result of an external lack, when it was, in fact, just a lack---a lack that is a nothingness: a self. This lack is the cure, not the sickness. Embracing this lack is the proper prescription for loneliness.

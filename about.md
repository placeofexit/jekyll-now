You have found a place of exit.

### About the Project

Those pursuing esoteric wisdom in the magical traditions of Myanmar often refer to *htwetyap pauk*, of which "place of exit" is a rough translation. For some, *htwetyap pauk* is an actual location, deep in the Himalayas. For others, it is a spiritual attainment preceding the total release of *nibbana*, one from which action in the world is still possible. The immortal inhabitants of this realm---those who have already arived---use it to bring less-advanced practitioners further along their paths, transmitting medicinal recipes, meditation techniques, and even secret teachings to those who know how to listen.

More generally, a place of exit is a site of fracture and instability within a given perspective. Those who wish to transcend their views and opinions seek a place of exit. Through it, they open themselves up to the world; from it, they draw others into new worlds.

There are many other names for a place of exit--the paradox, the absurd, *aporia*, the *dao*--and this blog is dedicated to embracing such diversity of expression. We host a variety of authors engaging with the questions that matter most to them, in the form of their choosing. We emplore each to embrace their own perspective in all its specificity and to earnestly engage with the views of others. We believe that the common root of all perspectives manifests *through* difference, not in spite of it. A place of exit can only emerge in the friction of a genuine encounter.

Do all these names indicate the same thing? Or is each name a different exit, a new opening? A place of exit lies in the space between these very questions.
